<p>Thorne's world began to warp like a reflection shattering on wet glass. The colors around him deepened, richened, the crimson of his shirt bleeding into burgundy, which seeped into indigo until it became one with the darkness. As he breathed in, the scent of smoke wafted from nowhere, leaving a taste of char on his tongue.</p>
<p>He tried to step forward, but his shoes seemed stuck, suspended mid-air as if rooted to the spot where the pavement ended and the city blurred. Skyscrapers melted like wax in a furnace, their silhouettes twisting into impossible geometries. Street signs creaked off, disintegrating at the edges like brittle leaves torn from nature's final dance before winter.</p>
<p>Thorne lifted his head, squinting up against an unsettling brightness that seared the retina, this wasn't even dawn yet, and night still lingered as a shroud around him. Neon was reborn to writhe on rooftops like living serpents; their gaudy reflections cast eerie silhouettes across crumbled pavement.</p>
<p>He knew why he felt so far from self-correcting reality: the void within had finally found its home.</p>
<p>&quot;Come with me,&quot; Thorne's ghost muttered, wincing as if slapped while trying to walk away from the mirror. He lunged for it, only to miss by inches, when was this world becoming a reflection now?</p>
<p>A soft moaning filled Thorne's ears, muffled and distant, with the sorrowful tone of old records played on vinyl in the depths of some musty storage room. Every other sound he detected added weight behind his growing unease: creaking, scuttling footsteps that paused when he shifted ground; muted hums from electronic speakers buried deep beneath his feet.</p>
<p>This felt more and more like trying to dig out his own brain, claw at the flesh of his soul until every memory came flooding back. Thorne stumbled forward, reaching into himself for control where shadows shrouded thought after disbelieving thought.</p>
<p>And when he finally found it: an image flickered as bright with panic in his mind's gaze. Eyes watched him from the void, eyes which might have belonged to someone else. Eyes that did fit inside an empty space left since yesterday when a lightbulb exploded on its own and no one bothered checking the fuse.</p>
<p>This world shattered once more, leaving Thorne floating in silence beyond all logic: an abandoned thought-boat drifting past unlit constellations he had memorized for a child's bedtime story. Then something swirled to anchor him back into this desolate sea, voices, whispers from unseen sources that grew louder by the second.</p>
<p>&quot;Spare yourself, boy,&quot; it pleaded, or maybe begged, Thorne couldn't quite make out the cadence.</p>
<p>And for an instant, a reflection flickered back in front of him. His fingers reached up to touch its skin as if willing back into flesh what now felt fragile enough to slip right through. Thorne's fingers trembled as he grasped for something tangible, anything to hold onto amidst this maelstrom of sounds and reflections. His ghostly form swirled closer to the mirror like a moth drawing flame, only to veer away in terror when his ethereal reflection stared back with an otherworldly intensity. The glassy surface rippled like water, its colors bleeding into one another as Thorne's breath fogged the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Spare yourself,&quot; a low, husky voice whispered from beyond the mirror. Thorne spun around, yet the speaker remained hidden, lost in the labyrinthine corridors of his own mind. Fragments of an older self murmured encouragement: &quot;It's okay...just calm down...&quot; But it wasn't just words; each syllable vibrated with urgency, echoing off surfaces like whispered secrets shared among conspirators.</p>
<p>The air filled with discordant echoes as Thorne frantically scrubbed clean a dusty corner of the room. Neon lights blazed to life above his head, setting shadows ablaze and turning his skin a sickly shade of green that seemed more alive than death would allow. Fractures etched across mirrored surfaces; fractured silences hung over crumbling streets like battle-hardened soldiers waiting for orders.</p>
<p>Thorne lurched toward the sound of distant music: an old piano's mournful refrain. Someone nearby, somewhere beneath this shattered reality? He caught glimpses of hands, bare knuckles white on palms stretched out from impossible limbs that seemed to unfold with each movement. Melancholy trills swelled to crescendos when fingers plucked air; harmony vanished when his own pulse spiked in counterpoint.</p>
<p>A faint scent wafted into the room, pungent and acrid like decaying wood or bruised flesh, smells from Thorne's past he couldn't afford to confront. He clenched around memories locked deep within; every attempt pushed walls forward with a screech of shattered glass. Each new echo coalesced his reality: fractured reflections, creaking steel hinges and mangled sheets, fragments piecing himself back into being like someone rearranging shards of broken glass into a jagged mosaic.</p>
<p>In the void beyond sanity's fragile border, eyes awaited Thorne with an unblinking presence that made skin crawl. Eyes they might belong to him now. In those dark pools his soul trembled; thoughts coalesced as shreds from the discarded remnants of yesterday, tomorrow, and before tomorrow unfolded a maze he could no longer discern reality within.</p>
<p>Whispers inched closer: disbelieving murmurs about what Thorne would do next or what was left to lose at this late stage of unravelling his own narrative. Franshise whispers. An unseen figure offered what felt like impossible guidance, hands guided toward mirrors reflecting shattered realities, beckoning toward fragments torn asunder.</p>
<p>Then there were the lights, distant beacons guiding Thorne through a maze of glass shards and twisted steel that seemed both fragile and impenetrable. Beyond reflection-shrouded streets, darkness waited; however, it too seemed crafted, like shadow puppeteers in an invisible theater where every action rippled forward a world beyond the boundaries of this forsaken scene.</p>
<p>&quot;Spare yourself,&quot; Thorne's ghost whispered now with urgency born from desperation, and stepped into an unknown reality where glass dissolved into mist. Thorne's fingers trailed along the splintered edge of a glass, the sharp ridges digging beneath his palm like razor wire. Each movement was deliberate, as if he sought to etch lines onto his skin, mapping the labyrinthine pathways of his own mind. Memories churned beneath the surface, refusing to be silenced. Flickering shards danced in the dim light, conjuring visions of broken promises, shattered glass, and a kaleidoscope of faces, some familiar, others distant whispers from forgotten conversations.</p>
<p>He crouched near the threshold of a door that opened onto a realm of fragmented thoughts. Walls curved like mangled steel, distorted reflections within twisting corridors that swayed with an unsettling life of their own. Every step resonated with the echoes of his own heartbeat, beating out a Morse code in cadence with the dissonant whispers that pursued him.</p>
<p>Glass shards crunched beneath Thorne's boots as he stepped into this eerie realm. Scattered along the floor, they glittered like lost hopes, each shard reflecting an aspect of his fractured psyche: shattered dreams, disintegrating alliances, echoes of memories locked away in the darkest recesses of his mind. His gaze wandered across the landscape of broken things, the scattered remnants of forgotten conversations with faces both loved and unloved.</p>
<p>As he walked, the labyrinth shifted around him like a dream-awakened demon. Walls receded, twisting into infinity; glass mirrors coalesced from shards like shards of a shattered heart, reflecting a million perspectives at once: laughter turned to tears; the promise of forever reduced to ephemeral whispers; shattering screams silenced by crushing pain.</p>
<p>A melody seeped through the fractures in his mind, dissonant chords drifting toward dissonance, like shards being reshuffled in an invisible card box. Chords that had lost all meaning except this fragile thread binding fragments together, threads woven from thorns and twisted steel. Yet amidst this cacophony of despair and sorrow, melancholy and desperation found themselves caught between what was broken, and the shattered possibilities waiting beyond the horizon.</p>
<p>Memories flickered like the flame of a dying fire, dancing with each step on the jagged path ahead. In that burning chaos, he glimpsed fleeting impressions from the past, echoes of his mother's laughter in late-night conversations; snippets of love letters torn by hand; whispers of forgotten promises within a deserted library.</p>
<p>He paused near a twisted column shrouded in glass shards, an air of shattered promise clinging to its surface like a shroud. Memories coalesced here: moments lived and lost with every beat of his pulse, the pain-laced scent that had entered the room as if someone else's memories were bleeding onto his own; and that voice, always there but only in the darkest corners of his dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do I keep looking?&quot;</p>
<p>Thorne didn't find himself the answers within these shattered reflections. Shadows seeped from between the fragments of broken walls: disquiet echoes; murmurs he couldn't quite hear; whispers promising a place where love and despair entwined to create something whole. In every step, every breath was weighed against what would emerge next.</p>
<p>The silence gathered around him, urging him toward some unknown truth hidden among these splintered thoughts, an invitation into that realm of reflection and disintegration. Thorne's feet sank deeper into the glassy floor as he navigated the shifting mosaic of memories. Shards refracted light, casting kaleidoscopic colors across his skin like a fever dream. The melody had grown more urgent, discordant notes thrumming beneath his fingers as if beckoning him toward some hidden door.</p>
<p>A fragment of glass slipped from beneath his foot and shattered on the cold stone. The sound was a tiny crack in the armor of silence, shattering only to be replaced by an uncomfortable stillness. Thorne's eyes scanned the twisted column before him, searching for a pattern or meaning behind the shattered promise. Memories seemed to cling to its surface like wisps of smoke, flickering impressions from days long past: his mother's warm touch on a chilly morning; the soft scratching of chalk on blackboard pages written in secret.</p>
<p>In that fleeting moment, time dissolved into another moment entirely. The words &quot;what if&quot; echoed through Thorne's mind like a prayer left unanswered. Why did he keep looking? He thought he'd sought answers within reflections, but now the search seemed futile.</p>
<p>Shards began to fall from above him, drifting down as silent raindrops on a gray morning. A single shard caught his eye, held by it only for an instant before floating away like an insect escaping sunlight. Thorne's heart kept pace with the falling glass shards, each slow descent was met with another question, like searching for meaning within an endless night.</p>
<p>As more memories burst forth, Thorne felt his own sense of identity begin to fray at the seams. Images blended together into disjointed conversations: staccato bursts from someone else's sorrow; laughter tinged with sadness and longing, all shared through echoes in abandoned rooms and the soft rustle of pages turned in secret.</p>
<p>In a moment where light was everything, shadows took form, fragments of darkness slipping around his ankles like living tendrils. His footsteps now faltered as doubts swirled, shadows growing longer with every step he made toward an unknown end.</p>
<p>An invisible thread began to unravel from within his core. The world was alive and watching him, its every fragment a puzzle waiting to be solved by Thorne's unwavering curiosity.</p>
<p>And so it danced across his skin like a whispered promise on air, threads woven of thorns, twisted steel, love letters penned in the dead of night. He knew only this: to unravel one more thread meant stepping further into an unknown world.</p>
<p>The ground beneath him was slick now as if polished with oil. Memories slipped away, lost in silence that gathered behind Thorne like a cold shroud, whispers promising redemption; murmurs speaking directly into his bones. With each step forward, an unending labyrinth unfolded before him. Every footstep he took became the door behind which something whole waited.</p>
<p>Thorne raised a hesitant hand for reassurance as if searching for guidance within unseen currents of light. There was time enough.</p>
<p>But he couldn't quite find it.</p>
<p>Still, Thorne forged on, leaving one thought, single note behind that seemed to reverberate against shattered hopes and dreams, one moment where hope and despair were in a symphony of chaos, suspended like frozen breaths in an infinite, shimmering night.</p>
<p class="back-to-top"><a href="#toc-container">↑ Back to Top</a></p>
<h2 id="memory-leak" tabindex="-1">Memory Leak <a class="direct-link" href="#memory-leak" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Thorne's eyes snapped open, and his world fragmented like shattered glass. The room he was in, a sterile beige-colored space with fluorescent lights humming overhead, began to warp and bend, like a funhouse mirror reflecting the true nature of his surroundings. Walls that were once straight and square now twisted into impossible angles, as if the very fabric of reality was being pulled taut.</p>
<p>A low hum filled the air, vibrating through every cell in Thorne's body. It started in his teeth, spreading to his tongue, then down his throat, leaving a tingling sensation that felt almost... musical. The sound became louder, until it was like standing at the edge of a waterfall, water cascading over smooth stone, echoing off hidden caverns deep within the earth.</p>
<p>His hand shot up from the surface he lay on, grasping for an imaginary grip to steady himself against the world's instability. But there was nothing there. Only a sheet of paper that fluttered in mid-air like a bird taking flight, its edges tracing the outline of Thorne's outstretched palm.</p>
<p>The room's colors shifted and deepened, moving from bright white to rich navy blue as if absorbing all the color from his surroundings. The air cooled, and a damp chill seeped through Thorne's skin. It was like walking onto a mist-shrouded moor at dawn, with dew-kissed grass beneath his boots.</p>
<p>A phrase materialized in the air above him: 'Time to wake up.' Words he knew well enough but refused to believe could be uttered by anyone around him. He blinked several times, willing it to clear, only for the words to reariously coalesce and begin reciting phrases at faster speeds, a litany of self-pitying sentiments Thorne had heard in his most darkest moments.</p>
<p>His fingers extended as if beckoning something toward them when an invisible force reached out with a faintly scritch-like quality. The sheets beneath him were rustling now like silk fabric slithering across metal, then an echo came back from far down his body: echoing whispers speaking directly into his bone marrow.</p>
<p>Thorne stood up, feeling roots dig deep into the ground to steady himself. Shadows slid along these roots as they moved closer, shadows that bled in with each movement and took shape as limbs they had long since lost, their blackness a contrast to an ever-widening world illuminated by colors beyond human comprehension.</p>
<p>The lights hummed louder now, forming the rhythmic pattern of piano keys being played. But what the notes actually said was lost on Thorne - all that mattered was that they sounded like the beat he had come to associate with redemption. A warmth seeped through Thorne's grasp, an echo of heat emanating from the surface beneath him. It felt more like a ghostly caress than a gentle breeze on this chilly morning, leaving behind goose flesh skin that tingled with every fiber of its being. His fingers flexed tighter around nothingness as if it was still clutched in his hand. He knew he lay flat, staring at the ceiling, no longer certain what reality or dreams were, or perhaps their indistinguishable dance on the surface known as life.</p>
<p>A voice pierced Thorne's haze like a ray of light shining through veils of cloud at dawn, but it still felt muffled, remote, echoing off far distances. Forgetting how his ear had managed to pinpoint its source, he turned it toward the sound and caught snatches of phrases floating on an underwater surface.</p>
<p>&quot;You are here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sarah.&quot; The word's soft breath resonated in Thorne's ears after 'you are here,' leaving a faint mark he could hardly read like frost forming on his glass.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome back,&quot; &quot;Welcome...&quot;</p>
<p>Thorne groaned aloud as pain sliced into the silence. Noises spilled from an alleyway away, then they all clamped shut as silently as whispers at night and darkness began to settle in.</p>
<p>A small light flickered near him, its tiny pulsations grew brighter each second until he sat bolt upright but found no air for lungs and stared up at blackness like the inside of a cave. An echo bounced off some distance down his spine.</p>
<p>&quot;Did I dream that?&quot; The question resurfaced from places Thorne thought he'd put the noise to sleep with, leaving him wondering how far reality had gone off the track before it started speaking phrases in whispers of what he'd heard on this night so long ago, before waking up like that.</p>
<p>Shadows gathered at his side, their length growing as they leaned forward like leaning branches. Their color was a reflection of Thorne's mood; one day they were blue, black on an earth and sky background. Then the days turned into weeks until he was stuck back in this place he'd had a habit to return back to so willingly. What did these shadows speak when it wanted voices most for people unable with life, their language woven like hair that looked just as tangled as his. The shadows leaned in closer, their silhouettes morphing like reflections on rippling water. The air thickened with an almost palpable scent, a reminder that life had always been about living, breathing, giving oneself up to the sensations of the world. One day they were blue; today they shifted toward indigo, like nights when the stars hadn't yet claimed their skies.</p>
<p>Thorne's stomach growled, protesting the absence of any sustenance it'd experienced in an eternity. No noise was too trivial, a creaking floorboard became something sinister and ominous as if time itself moved away with its steps. The light above flickered once more, making him hesitate for what felt like an eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want?&quot; His voice scratched against the skin of quiet, not because he feared being overheard but more likely because no one ever listened to his requests anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been waiting,&quot; their dark form whispered a gentle breeze. They didn't grow quieter with each passing moment; every word hung heavy and expectant as if waiting for an acknowledgment which never came. It had always been Thorne who'd waited, patiently stuck in memories like these shadows in time.</p>
<p>&quot;Waiting for what?&quot; His eyes darted around the confined, dark space but seeing nothing other than flickering light at the far end of it, distant enough to make him feel invisible altogether. Shadows gathered in a knot near where he'd been when awakened on that night so very long ago, as blue had given over way to an indigo hue which grew darker by each passing day.</p>
<p>&quot;Sarah,&quot; the voice cut through with ease once more but still felt muffled and far away; echoing off surfaces like an underwater breath resurfacing. &quot;Welcome back.&quot;</p>
<p>Thorne let out a groan of frustration mixed with some relief, finally admitting his existence after so long. It was times like these he'd wished life had only been a thought, any concept less heavy on a world that weighed upon him each waking moment as much as those still unknown hours at the bottom of this dark pit of a body and soul.</p>
<p>There was no room in the dim, empty air for movement; every step forward felt against the weight holding his whole existence captive. And yet he stirred. Each movement echoed with a faintness that sounded more like an echo before it made its way into reality or turned down to a mere whispered sigh in time. It reminded Thorne of how words sounded right after silence had swallowed them whole when the world around him felt less real and much darker than ever.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; his response escaped breathlessly, betraying the fear lurking within even as anger began to seep its way to it like water from its source. His anger stirred with power that seemed almost contained in the limits of their darkness; only a little at times when they turned into blue again but that spark never grew and only led him further down.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want back.&quot; The words felt raw, almost cut from his lips before some unheard power made time warp reality one last time like shadows did by shifting colors to remind them of days long past. Weeks had blended seamlessly with each other when looking at this place, a prison of his own making since he was powerless against that strange binding that only released more questions he'd yet been trying to get away from.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome back,&quot; the voice drifted closer with purpose but Thorne turned away instead, unable to bear its familiarity. Memories always were and will remain what they are, reminders in this dark life about where things had started so terribly wrong. Thorne's retreating back cast a partial shadow on the walls of his cell, like a fleeting ghost trying to escape its own existence. The only response to his movement was an unsettling whisper that lingered as though it wanted to cling to his awareness for just one more moment. His shoulders remained tense, ready to respond but unable to move towards or away from anything, the silence was suffocating; even his breathing seemed frozen.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want now?&quot; His voice grated through dry lips like sandpaper worn thin, making every word painful to form and yet unwillingly compelled by the unseen force tugging him back into this pit of despair. He couldn't remember the last time he'd moved forward, only that backward was all there ever seemed to be, a cycle he kept repeating with each step leading further down.</p>
<p>&quot;Sarah,&quot; the voice whispered again closer now, its tone devoid of any inflection or emotion but suffused with an unnerving familiarity that chilled Thorne to his very core. It was like standing in front of a mirror, peering at oneself from within; distorted and grotesque because he saw every part that needed repair, broken edges where others found perfection, each imperfection echoing the cracks in himself as if this voice might try and sew them together.</p>
<p>&quot;Sarah?&quot; He breathed out slow and labored, the air leaving him aching like his body. &quot;I'm... I don't know who you are.&quot; A lie he wasn't sure he was willing to live by. Truths were hard but easier on the heart because they'd always been there before though sometimes they couldn't be trusted either.</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps echoed, growing louder as they approached, like sand grains running down a glass slide. Each step created vibrations where his skin met the ground, a tangible proof that nothing between here and where he wanted was infinite distance, it seemed; in fact, quite all too close for comfort.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm back,&quot; the voice announced finally appearing at his side, its presence stark as an object dropped straight down on top of one's chest. It pressed into Thorne's awareness without asking permission or being asked if that was truly alright by him, moving with a purpose not for rescue but to force him deeper into this nightmare he refused to remember being real.</p>
<p>&quot;What... I want you to know,&quot; the stranger took steps back and paused, each movement deliberate as if every inch counted. The air around them now hung heavy with the weight of their mutual understanding, making it hard for Thorne's mind to think anything else besides the suffocating darkness that had been their existence since this place appeared, and how much he yearned to be done with it.</p>
<p>&quot;We can work through this—through whatever came before,&quot; Sarah said, turning around with her back to him, forcing Thorne into watching this act of defiance for what felt like hours. &quot;We can begin the healing process now.&quot; Her response left less to interpret than her actual state; fear or determination? Was she trying to lift him up from his despair, or merely setting fire to it?</p>
<p>&quot;Work through what?&quot; Thorne found himself answering more out of morbid curiosity than a genuine desire to engage. This voice seemed designed for its current role, to nudge and prod with every question as if prodding at an open wound, until the raw edges needed no further healing.</p>
<p>&quot;I want you to see that what destroyed your past had nothing to do with who you are now,&quot; Sarah spoke into this new void, her words like a whispered mantra trying to bring back light in a place once so thoroughly extinguished by darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;And what exactly would happen if I didn't? If I refused?&quot; The response bubbled from his lips before he realized it, like water rising in parched earth but quickly followed on as inevitable. &quot;Refuse?&quot;</p>
<p>Sarah turned and walked toward the cell's only light source, a thin beam shot through tiny gaps between walls at this height that cast an illusory boundary; they never let Thorne touch him without looking inside of his very own hell, yet today they both knew there needed to be change.</p>
<p>&quot;You could end up losing more,&quot; Sarah cautioned with each step now bringing her closer and closer until she almost touched the wall of mirrors staring at their dark pasts in silence.</p>
<p>Thorn’s eyes turned towards this ominous prediction as he rose against the weight holding him; not because it would set right, but a small spark within them refused nothing. It was an unyielding refusal, a will to fight no matter for whom or what he fought — still there was light inside when darkness seemed impossible.</p>
<p>&quot;Or... who you thought I'd be?&quot; Thorne asked in a mumble that almost didn’t leave his lips at all, but the faintest whisper felt like all that remained of him trying anything to defy this suffocating prison and break free from each shackled memory.</p>
<p class="back-to-top"><a href="#toc-container">↑ Back to Top</a></p>
<h2 id="the-corrupted-district" tabindex="-1">The Corrupted District <a class="direct-link" href="#the-corrupted-district" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Thorne's gaze lingered on Sarah's retreating back as she moved closer to him, her footsteps echoing off the mirrored walls like specters of past regrets. The light source cast an otherworldly glow, making their surroundings seem almost, but not quite, real. He allowed his eyes to follow her, drinking in every detail: the way her dark hair cascaded down her back, like a river of night; the sharp line of her jaw as she navigated the narrow space between him and the door.</p>
<p>The prison he called home was one of reflections, where every surface seemed to ripple with the ghosts of memories long buried. The mirrors, usually his greatest tormentor, now appeared almost... benign? Was it wishful thinking? No, a cold voice within him reminded him, as unyielding as the glass that held him captive.</p>
<p>Sarah's breathing grew more deliberate, each inhale and exhale punctuating her steps with an increasingly measured cadence. Thorne detected no hesitation in her pace; only purpose, determination? Her shoulders squared in a way he hadn't seen before; it was almost... confident? Fearful, yet untimidated. Her grip on hope felt stronger than ever.</p>
<p>As she drew closer, the line between past and present began to blur. Memories, which had long sought asylum within these cold walls, now stirred, awakened, possibly? They seeped out in wisps of forgotten moments: laughter; a summer afternoon spent chasing fireflies with Sarah; or that stormy night he thought would have destroyed him yet ultimately set him free.</p>
<p>Sarah's voice turned down to a sigh, almost apologetic, yet not quite. 'Can you trust me?' It sent shivers through Thorne, like a current passing from one end of the spectrum to the other, excitement; trepidation. The sound itself didn't seem to be coming from her. This whispered questioning sounded more like his own thoughts when wrestling the last threads of sanity he still held.</p>
<p>A pause. Then Sarah reached out and grasped the wall beside him with a pair of cold fingers, her grip leaving faint streaks in its metallic trail as if tracing back every memory he'd tried so desperately to push away. It was an intimate gesture, intimate for someone trapped behind thick steel and mirrors that only reflected his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;You can trust me,&quot; she whispered now, as clear as any promise could be when bound to the will of those controlling this digital prison. Her words cut through a wall of fear he knew was still inside him, even as her voice resonated within every cell of this makeshift world, where anything and everything had become distorted reality.</p>
<p>And it was there - at that instant, in the mirror-lined labyrinth, where Thorne finally caught Sarah's gaze. For what felt like moments, they were two people again, face to unblemished face, lost in each other once more. Their eyes locked; understanding or accusation, only one thing was certain now: they had no choice but to proceed down this twisted virtual road if their ghosts wanted the same thing as him.</p>
<p>But before he could answer 'I trust you,' a faint shiver passed through Sarah's hand grasping at the cold metal wall, leaving behind tiny smudges of light on her fingertips, like whispers carried by rain-borne winds from some far-distant land. They grew larger and began to spread - their slow spread revealing files within these confined areas began to disappear one after another, and in doing so broke a reflection that Thorne had built over time to ward off the darkness surrounding him.</p>
<p>A pixel shivered out of place, followed by others. Each one that fell was like tiny snowflakes that vanished into an endless, swirling mass - revealing at its heart the dark core Thorne still tried with desperate resolve not to give in to. The digital world began to glitch around them, once familiar lines and shapes twisting wildly against reality as if some sinister force tore back the seams it had so meticulously woven.</p>
<p>And in this chaotic dance of light, shadows and shifting boundaries, Sarah's words turned into an urgent reminder: There could be no turning back. In her presence, a flicker showed Thorne the truth: his fight for existence wasn't against the outside; but within himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked aloud, finally breaking free from the silence - even as fear threatened to choke him whole again.</p>
<p>Sarah turned this time with an air of confidence; one that no longer questioned for her. Her shoulders squared, or was it just the walls? It was hard to discern anymore. The soft glow of the luminescent orbs cast an eerie dance upon the walls as Thorne and Sarah navigated through the ever-shifting labyrinth. The gentle pulse of the light source seemed out of place amidst the chaos, a beacon of hope in a world that had grown increasingly desperate. Shadows twisted and writhed like living things, seeking to snuff the fragile luminescence from existence.</p>
<p>With each file deleted, the illumination began to wane, as if the very fabric of reality was slowly unraveling. The light's gentle warmth receded, leaving only an icy pallor in its wake. Thorne slowed his pace, his eyes scanning the surrounding area for any sign of danger, though he knew it was futile, his instincts already battered and bruised.</p>
<p>The air was heavy with the acrid tang of burnt circuitry, a noxious odor that clung to his skin like a shroud. It stank of decay, as if the very essence of their digital existence was succumbing to some long-forgotten corruption. The smell made Thorne's stomach lurch, his breath catching in his throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Sarah? Is this... is this it?&quot; Thorne asked, his voice barely above a whisper, his words echoing off the walls like a ghostly incantation.</p>
<p>Sarah's response was immediate, her tone steady and unwavering. &quot;No, Thorne. I think we just hit a node point before moving deeper into the system.&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, the words took on a strange, echoey resonance, like they were being transmitted to an unseen listener. The shadows seemed to shift in agreement, coalescing into something vaguely disturbing, but Thorne knew better.</p>
<p>The machine, once a proud and gleaming monolith, now stumbled and lurched to life, its metal skin crackling with static electricity. It sent bolts of blue-white energy shooting forward like angry fingers, only to be snuffed out by the very walls that sought to contain them.</p>
<p>Beneath their feet, the floorplates seemed to ripple and flex, like the surface of a pond struck by some unseen stone. The air was alive with vibrations, a sympathetic hum that resonated through every molecule in his body, from the tips of Thorne's fingers to the soles of his shoes.</p>
<p>Sarah moved forward, her pace measured but insistent, as if driving herself forward against an invisible will. Thorne followed closely, his heart pounding a nervous rhythm in time with hers.</p>
<p>Their footsteps echoed off the walls, creating a disorienting cacophony that threatened to overwhelm their senses. Sounds swirled around them, metallic clangs, electrical whines, whispers carried on the wind like distant voices calling out from beyond the veil of reality.</p>
<p>Ahead, Thorne caught glimpses of his surroundings through fragmented reflections. The shattered remnants of a windowspane revealed a glimpse of starlight bleeding across the dark horizon; a jagged fragment of what had once been a smile cast a macabre grin onto the face of a twisted statue; in the distance, fragments of sky and sun glowed like dying embers.</p>
<p>Each reflection was like looking into an other's soul, painful, heartbreaking glimpses of someone else's life unfolding across those fractured surfaces. Shadows seemed to seep from the reflections themselves, crawling out onto Thorne's skin with malevolent intent.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they stumbled into a dead space, a room devoid of even this pitiful echo-illuminance. In its heart lay an abyssal chasm of darkness that swallowed all light and hope in equal measure, where shadows hung suspended like macabre trophies on the walls.</p>
<p>Sarah hesitated, ever so lightly, at the threshold of this unforgiving void. Thorne caught her hand in his, their fingers intertwining as a conduit to sanity in a system rapidly unraveling within themselves.</p>
<p>Thorne took a deep breath and plunged headlong into the abyss, letting go of hope as he plummeted down into these dark, labyrinthine waters. The darkness was a living, breathing entity that wrapped itself around Thorne's ankles like a cold, damp shroud. It seeped into his bones, chilling him to the marrow. He pulled Sarah closer, her hand a lifeline in this seemingly bottomless pit.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are we?&quot; she whispered, her voice barely audible over the cacophony of echoes that swirled around them.</p>
<p>Thorne didn't answer. His gaze was fixed on the fractured glass of the statue ahead. The shattered remnants reflected all manner of fragments, stars, suns, moonlit landscapes that blurred together in a maddening dance. A faint whisper echoed through the void, a voice he couldn't quite make out.</p>
<p>As they moved forward, the reflections began to change. Glimpses of cities gave way to desolate landscapes, each reflection revealing a new life's tale, one Thorne had experienced once, but which now seemed like an eternity ago. Faces flickered across his mind, whispers from a forgotten past, echoes of long-forgotten laughter.</p>
<p>Memories stirred in the depths of his mind, awakening from the dusty recesses like trapped insects escaping their jarred confines. The air vibrated with electricity as each recollection unfolded its own world: Thorne's sister, bright blue eyes shining in the firelight; Emily, her skin glowing like a moonlit alabaster; and Sarah herself, her face shattering under the cruel touch of fate.</p>
<p>The memories swirled, an untethered maelstrom that pulled Thorne screaming from the very edge of sanity. He stumbled, his grip on reality faltering as each recollection collided with the next in a dizzying cascade. Shadows lunged at him like grasping fingers, the ghostly echoes of lives past and present, their malevolent energy seeking to consume Thorne whole.</p>
<p>Sarah halted her pace momentarily, transfixed by the fluid dance of reflections. Her eyes were like those of a sleepwalker, mesmerized by some forgotten melody in the void. 'Thorne caught his wrist with an iron hand, snapping Sarah's back into focus.'</p>
<p>'Where are we?' she asked again, this time a touch louder.</p>
<p>Thorne released her wrist and surveyed their surroundings, taking stock of their dwindling options. The void behind them hung like a specter, an ominous presence gathering momentum for each passing moment. In its heart, memories thrashed against the cold darkness, dying embers where starlight glowed faintly on the periphery.</p>
<p>'Let's keep moving,' Thorne called out to Sarah. 'We need to find that Core Memory before...before everything just disappears.'</p>
<p>Sarah took a step forward, hesitated, then walked towards the void beneath them. The air around her seemed to grow colder, the shadows deepening until they resembled vast oceans swirling against their shores.</p>
<p>The abyss beckoned still. They were on a cusp of existence and oblivion, hurtling headlong into that great gulf without a thread to cling to.</p>
<p>With Sarah leading the way and thorns at his throat, Thorne plunged deeper into this twisted realm, leaving everything behind for an elusive memory, which hung like a fleeting mirage at the very edge of sanity. As Thorne descended into the heart of the void, the shadows enveloped him like a shroud, heavy with the weight of unspoken truths. He felt an almost imperceptible tremor beneath his feet, like the reverberations of a great chord strummed silently by some unseen hand. The air pulsed around him, alive with an otherworldly music, whispers, sighs, and hollow reed-like cries that blended together in a cacophony both haunting and mesmerizing.</p>
<p>Sarah's lead was lithe and fluid, her steps tracing the uneven terrain like the delicate dance of a spider unwinding its web. The landscape itself seemed to writhe and twist, as if it too were attempting to claim its due in this macabre pas de deux. Every rock, every twisted root, seemed to hold some hidden significance, echoes of lives lived, loved, lost.</p>
<p>Thorne followed closely, his eyes drinking in the kaleidoscope of sensations surrounding him. He felt as though he was drowning in a sea of memories, each one clamoring for attention like a beggar on the edge of sanity's thinning rope. And yet, with Sarah by his side, he found himself wading through this torrent rather than faltering beneath its surface.</p>
<p>The closer they moved towards their goal, the clearer it became, that finding the Core Memory would be more than mere escapism from oblivion. It was an altar on which to confront the very demons that had haunted him for what felt like such a long time. Thorne found himself drawing on memories he'd rather leave buried, each one a burning lesson in how little his thoughts allowed him to face his world head-on.</p>
<p>A jagged peak thrust into view ahead, some twisted monument crafted from the raw, jagged essence of pain itself. The air reeked with the heavy scent of salt spray and the distant tang of burning flowers. Beneath this was a sickly sweet undertone reminiscent of honey, the taste akin to what Thorne's stomach turned up at the memory of Emily.</p>
<p>Sarah led him down towards the heart of that twisted peak, her voice low and uncertain, 'What lies within? We must be certain we have found it before moving further.'</p>
<p>Thorne hesitated. There was an aura here that spoke against going forward, that a precipice held on every inch of their way back up, where anything broken could never again be made whole.</p>
<p>But he pushed open the door that stood at his left shoulder, and stepped into darkness; for within those shadows now dwelled secrets.</p>
<p>'Perhaps it is not what lies ahead but behind that awaits us.' His words seemed to find some internal resonance, like the deep resonance of bell peals struck across timelessness. There seemed an unmistakable echo hidden under them, resonating the question.</p>
<p>Sarah's voice was hesitant as her eyes slid between him and into their path forward once more.</p>
<p>'Tell me.'</p>
<p>Thorne did, that one voice speaking a final word against silence, drawing an unyielding curtain on all the pain for which they were currently striving.</p>
<p>In his mind, Thorne found himself walking toward the core's shadowy reflection. He walked towards it even though he felt every fiber of him pushing away; because what he wanted now had no boundaries. The line between thought and reality began to blur, as in those fleeting moments right at the edge of an eclipse.</p>

<h2 id="the-mirror-room" tabindex="-1">The Mirror Room <a class="direct-link" href="#the-mirror-room" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>The air clung to Thorne's skin like a damp shroud, heavy with the scent of salt spray and the distant tang of burning flowers. The jagged peak loomed ahead, an otherworldly monolith twisted from the raw essence of pain itself. Beneath its presence, a sickly sweet undertone seeped into his nostrils, likened the taste that churned in Thorne's stomach like acid, the memory of Emily.</p>
<p>As he drew near, Thorne's thoughts grew jumbled, tangled by the weight of these memories. His hand grasped Sarah's offered arm, her fingers intertwining with his like two halves forming a broken bond. Her voice guided him forward, hesitant and uncertain, 'What lies within?' she asked once more, her words as fragile as the thin veneer on the peak's scarred surface.</p>
<p>Thorne hesitated, sensing the darkness gathering like a shroud beneath their feet. Something lurked in every shadow, unwilling to yield its hold. His heart trembled with foreboding; he stood at the precipice of every inch, where any fissure might splinter into unforgiving irreparable shards. But it was not the unknown within that chilled him but rather what resided just beyond: shrouded and unyielding silence.</p>
<p>'Perhaps,' Thorne ventured softly, trying to voice thoughts he knew were impossible: 'it is not what lies ahead but behind that awaits us.'</p>
<p>His words struck a resonant chord, echoing in harmony like bell peals struck against timelessness. They took shape as phrases, harmoniously combining into one unyielding phrase, one final barrier to silence that could never be breached. He voiced it, though his heart knew better and screamed for restraint; he gave voice for the memories Thorne's world had been haunted by.</p>
<p>There was no movement as Sarah slid her eyes between the jagged peaks stretching either side of their view; an almost forgotten pause in between before they gazed once more into darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; a hesitant whisper came out, breaking through each still point like time itself unraveling and rewinding around them. The air clung to Thorne's skin like a damp shroud, heavy with the scent of salt spray and the distant tang of burning flowers. The jagged peak loomed ahead, its twisted form a macabre parody of twisted desire. Beneath its presence, a sickly sweet undertone seeped into his nostrils, likened the taste that churned in Thorne's stomach like acid, the memory of Emily.</p>
<p>As he drew near, the landscape itself seemed to shift and writhe, as if alive and responding to the turmoil within his mind. Sarah's offered arm felt fragile against his own, yet reassuring in its touch. Her fingers intertwining with his were a gentle counterpoint to the jagged, fractured edges that lined the peak's surface.</p>
<p>&quot;What lies within?&quot; she breathed, her voice hesitant as a leaf caught in an autumn gale.</p>
<p>Thorne hesitated, sensing the darkness gathering around them like a shroud. Something lurked in every shadow, unwilling to yield its hold. He could feel the thrum of it, a vibration that ran through his veins and made his heart tremble with foreboding. It was not the unknown within the peak's depths that chilled him so much as what resided just beyond, shrouded and unyielding silence.</p>
<p>And yet they pressed on, their footsteps echoed by the hollows of the cliff face. The sound was oppressive, a heavy weight that hung in the air like a challenge. Thorne could feel it pressing down upon him, making every breath a labor of will.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; he ventured softly, trying to voice thoughts he knew were impossible. &quot;It is not what lies ahead but behind that awaits us.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarah's eyes flickered between his and the jagged peaks stretching either side of their view, a pause in her breathing that was almost imperceptible before she met his gaze once more.</p>
<p>&quot;Behind?&quot; she repeated, her voice breaking like fragile glass.</p>
<p>Thorne felt a shiver run down his spine as he watched her glance back at him. Her eyes were mirrors reflecting the depths within his own soul, a turbulent sea of anger and regret, of shattered dreams and lost loves. And in that moment, it seemed to him that she saw everything, all the secrets, all the lies, all the guilt and shame packed into every crevice of his heart.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; her voice whispered, the question trembling on the edge of words like a newborn's cry on its first breath. &quot;What is it that you're not asking?&quot;</p>
<p>In the sudden silence, Thorne felt the land itself seem to hold its breath, as if waiting for an answer he might not even choose to give.</p>
<p>&quot;All things,&quot; he murmured finally, the word swallowed by a sigh of salt-soaked air that rolled through his head like bitter perfume. &quot;All things are bound here, secrets and sins, memories and desires. And it's in the silences between them that we find the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarah shifted her foot on the loose stone beneath her foot, and Thorne felt a fleeting spark of movement before she froze once more.</p>
<p>&quot;Like a shadow,&quot; she whispered, &quot;following its reflection.&quot;</p>
<p>Thorne's eyes flicked to hers, their gazes meeting in an unspoken understanding. In that instant, he knew they were stepping into the realm where guilt and shame held sway, a land that ruled by nothing but the weight of its own presence, pressing down upon all who dared enter like a force both crushing and yet oddly exhilarating.</p>
<p>And so, Thorne took another step forward, as if pulled by an unseen hand that reached out across vast expanses of darkening memory. The silence was building now, gathering pace to some great crescendo, a final warning before some unknown catastrophe.</p>
<p>Sarah stood close behind him, her own hand hesitating on his arm like a tentative touch. Thorne felt it there, solid and reassuring in its anchor against the void, as they both went one step deeper into the secret heart of this forsaken place.</p>
<p>In that instant, darkness trembled, but for no more than an instant. For in a flash of pure insight, Thorne perceived the unfathomable truth in all its unbreachable vastness.</p>
<p>For that is where he had truly started to climb The air was heavy with the scent of blooming cypress, their black petals unfolding like skeletal fingers beneath the sullen sky. Thorne's boots crunched on the damp earth as he stepped across the narrow ridge, a jagged line etched through the terrain by some long-forgotten cataclysm. The ground vibrated beneath his feet, each tremor resonating with an unnamable ache.</p>
<p>Sarah walked beside him, her hand still clasped around his arm like a tentative lifeline. Each step forced her closer to the precipice, the silence building between them an unbreakable chasm that threatened to swallow her whole. Her breath was quick and light, her eyes shifting between the ridges of memory-etched stone, half-expecting to find some key hidden behind each fractured face.</p>
<p>Thorne halted at a copse of tangled silver birch, their silver bark streaked with rust-red lichen that seemed almost edible in the fading daylight. He leaned forward to take a swig from his flask, and for an instant, it rained down on him like dark benediction while he poured water into Sarah's cup.</p>
<p>When she sipped its cool darkness dry, Thorne tossed her a silver-tipped coin which she tucked beneath her sleeve as he took another sip, the cold liquor quivering at the back of his throat like a tiny snake. The silence now felt oppressive enough to give it teeth, that final moment where one thought could be turned against you with enough pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what I meant by twisted reality,&quot; Thorne said softly, trying the taste off the silver lip of his flask once more.</p>
<p>Sarah hesitated and let her hand slide free from his arm as she leaned slightly forward. The flicker in their locked gazes sent a ripple through them both - for just that single moment there had been a fragile promise made on something like the edge of possibility, their fingers reaching toward each other to meet somewhere over their heads.</p>
<p>The darkness deepened with the step he had not taken. It grew thick enough to cling to his clothes in cold wisps, and his breath puffed out small stars that vanished before they ever were more than a thought.</p>
<p>&quot;You're afraid,&quot; Sarah whispered when Thorne hesitated at a place marked only by the curve of weathered stone where their footfalls paused, her voice barely large enough to fill his palm.</p>
<p>Thorne twisted it open on one side of his throat. It swelled there for him like flesh about to burst into something it could no longer contain, and the taste was as sharp as glass that had shattered, all delicate edges left behind, each chipped away at the point where past and future blurred.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid what I might say,&quot; he finally allowed, before she fell back, her arms out around him like shelter in this place where love went to be crushed.</p>
<p>There was something that made their bodies lock as his hand closed over hers as he took another step deeper towards a land from which few returned, though the air seemed heavier with every step and their breath came in measured time. The air clung to Thorne's skin like wet leather, heavy with the scent of rain and decay. He felt Sarah's gaze on his back as he moved forward, her eyes tracing the lines of his worn coat and the dark threads that stitched it together like a patchwork shroud. The silence between them grew thicker, a palpable mist that clung to every surface.</p>
<p>As they stepped over the weathered stone, its worn face gazed up at Thorne like an old, cracked mirror reflecting his own fear. He could feel Sarah's weight shifting, her shoulder brushing against his as she fell into step beside him. Her voice whispered against his ear, a gentle breeze that rustled his hair.</p>
<p>&quot;What's holding you back, Thorne?&quot; she asked, her breath warm against his skin.</p>
<p>He twisted the lock on his throat, feeling the rough wood of the mechanism scraping against his vocal cords like sandpaper. The word stuck in his throat, caught between the taste of whiskey and the bitter edge of his fear. He swallowed hard, the sound echoing through the stillness like a warning bell tolling in his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Just getting used to it,&quot; he lied, his voice low and flat as the rain-soaked earth beneath their feet. The drop seemed to hang suspended in mid-air, each passing moment making it feel heavier until Thorne felt as though he was drowning in its weight.</p>
<p>&quot;What's out there?&quot; Sarah asked softly, her words lost to the darkness like embers dying on damp ash. &quot;Why won't you take a step forward?&quot;</p>
<p>Thorne spun around, his hand closing over hers with a force that startled both of them. He hauled her closer, their feet tangling as he steered her against his chest. The warmth of her core radiated through his jacket to the cold, hard stone beneath his clothes, and for an instant Thorne felt like he could finally take hold of something.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a step forward,&quot; he whispered into her ear, his breath dancing in her hair like autumn leaves blown down a forgotten path. &quot;It's taking back.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarah's questions hung suspended between them like smoke from gunpowder, each one trailing off as the silence gathered its own dark truth.</p>
<p>As Thorne spoke, Sarah's gaze dropped to the ground, tracing lines of shadow into every corner. Shadows that shifted and rearranged themselves according to their deepest fears, Thorne saw her mind weaving it together like some half-remembered thread of a tapestry he'd never finished sewing.</p>
<p>But when his voice trailed off and she finally dared look up at him, the space between them had twisted to reflect all too true the weight that weighed upon each breath: heavy shadows and unforgiving steps on roads marked with secret lies, a world as fractured as Thorne's thoughts where some edges refused to be sewed back together.</p>
<p>Sarah stepped closer, but in the hushed room they found only echoes whispering through them.</p>
<p class="back-to-top"><a href="#toc-container">↑ Back to Top</a></p>
<h2 id="the-long-goodbye" tabindex="-1">The Long Goodbye <a class="direct-link" href="#the-long-goodbye" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Thorne's eyelids fluttered open, the brightness of the lamp above him like a rusty nail to his brain. He was lying on a surface that felt like concrete - an unyielding hardness that mocked his fatigue. As he struggled to sit up, a wave of dizziness washed over him, making his vision blur like the edges of a watercolor painting. The room's familiar contours began to resolve, a narrow bed pushed against one wall with a worn denim-covered door at its adjacent edge.</p>
<p>To his right lay the stack - a mess of unwilled wires and crumpled whiteboards scrawled with codes he hadn't yet deciphered. This morning's attempt had ended in failure when the device had spat forth data like furious pistachios being fed into his skull: it still seeped into his consciousness, each snippet of information adding itself to a hazy, jumbled tapestry. Yet, there was something else buried deep alongside the familiar contours - something only faintly recognized; that which belonged to her presence now.</p>
<p>An uninvited guest had moved into Thorne's neural connection overnight: a foreign thread spun through the very fabric of his mind. It seeped forward like morning dew on autumn grass at dawn, dampening every attempt to maintain an edge around his perception. In its place was Sarah - her memory imprinted with the tangy taste he still needed to shake - but what memories were those?</p>
<p>&quot;What do you see?&quot; Thorne called out in a voice no louder than sunlight through thin curtains.</p>
<p>&quot;No vision in front of me, Thorne,&quot; the only reply came from behind him. An echoing silence seeped into his spine like cold fog creeping across moonlit ground; it spoke no further.</p>
<p>Thorne swung his legs over the bed edge to plant both toes onto firm cement; a reassuring solidity when reality was twisted and wrenched by Sarah's presence.</p>
<p>His voice cracked on another question he'd long held back. &quot;Is this part of you?&quot;</p>
<p>Sarah stepped closer now - an unadulterated, silent presence that pressed him into something greater than himself. She towered over him, shadow-quiet in her jeans; eyes blackered with exhaustion, like rainwater clouding a glassy pond at dusk.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she admitted softly when he still remained speechless, the phrase slipping from lips as unworn by years of silence.</p>
<p>In that void formed around them - darkness laced with every muffled ache and pain that clung to Thorne's existence - both their gazes found an unseen point in time which felt like something between memory and dreams.</p>
<p>But what did she remember?</p>
<p>Their hands touched. Like sudden ice it flowed along his skin, each tendril tinged by her presence.</p>
<p>Her eyes turned; seeking answers behind the frayed patterns that had formed on the walls since Thorne's last bout of lucidity began...</p>
<p>As shadows rearranged to reveal fragments of shattered mirrors he found solace in the touch of her hand; its warmth seeped his chilled fingers. Their palms joined - as two puzzle pieces clicked into place.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Thorne turned and stumbled off towards that dark space where a faint hum thrummed through every nerve of his body... Thorne's legs sank into the worn mattress as he swung his feet over to plant them firmly on cold, unforgiving concrete. The chill of the surface seeped into his soles, a reminder that his bedroom was now a threshold between worlds - worlds he couldn't quite grasp onto anymore. His gaze drifted towards the city skyline outside the window, a blur of steel and glass skyscrapers pierced by neon lights that danced like fireflies on a summer night.</p>
<p>A faint scratch echoed through the room, followed by another, as if fingernails on wood scraped against each other in slow, deliberate rhythm. The sound sent a shiver down Thorne's spine. He turned away from the window to face his bed, its sheets tangled into a mess that resembled spider webs after a rainstorm. A photograph of him and Sarah lay discarded beside it, the corners curled like paper burns left unattended.</p>
<p>The camera's lens had captured two things at once: their love, a flickering flame of joy and tenderness - and their impending divorce, an uncertain horizon where they'd promised to part ways. Yet, here he was, sitting on his bed in a state hospital, being kept under observation like some broken puzzle no longer whole.</p>
<p>Thorne's eyes drifted toward the wall where Sarah had painted an abstract of themselves as art students at city college. Brushstrokes vibrant and chaotic swirled through colors that glinted under dim fluorescent light. Her touch echoed now within his chest: a gentle caress he'd always been too afraid to express, too scared it might fade away like yesterday's rain.</p>
<p>A voice came from behind Thorne, as low as a muffled sigh, which only served to stir up something primal - fear or hope? He rotated back toward that space silently occupied by his shadow self. His eyes narrowed against what he hadn't expected: Sarah walking out of thin air into the room... no, onto the bed beside him.</p>
<p>&quot;Where do you want us to begin?&quot; she asked in a soft voice as gentle as morning dew.</p>
<p>Her words dissolved into nothingness once their palms collided, sending an icy chill all over his body. It seeped like frost, spreading fingers together with her warmth. In that moment, time itself seemed warped; what was cold became warm and vice versa.</p>
<p>&quot;No beginning for us,&quot; Thorne managed to say, the sound cracking him. Her hands fell away as if she'd been holding an electrified piece of wire - and left him chilled for a good few seconds before they came together again like two pieces of ice in a fire.</p>
<p>In that fusion, their gazes met over the frayed edges of fractured mirrors on the walls, each piece overlapping another. There was nothing between what they saw.</p>
<p>As they touched, shadows stirred to reveal more than just what remained - there were moments lost along time. Crumbs scattered under forgotten coffee tables, a child's drawing scribbled in bold charcoal near a park bench. Fragments of lives past and present intertwined.</p>
<p>It dawned on him then: this reality shifting wasn't hers. It was his own memories unraveling like a thread pulled out of a sweater. She moved closer to Thorne, so close that her lips barely touched his fingertips.</p>
<p>With her hand resting against the cold concrete, Thorne spotted something beneath her sleeve - an ink stain the shape and size of New York City on an old shirt, with the name scribbled beside it: &quot;Evelyn.&quot; But there was only one other detail, almost indistinguishable beneath a smudge: E. for Emily, the daughter he'd lost in another world.</p>
<p>The sound of rain started, a relentless beat against the small space between them. It felt like something ancient inside him had been waiting for its cue to start pounding - now it did.</p>
<p>Their gazes still entwined with hers over the walls as if searching through some great mystery, Thorne stood slowly up from his bed and began walking toward that dark space behind Sarah in a haze of rain that swirled around her like fog on a road. And then she vanished once more.</p>
<p>All left was dust, echoes of rain pattering against an unseen surface - and a single photograph, half-pressed into the dust like it had been forgotten forever. The rain didn't stop, only the sound of it changed. It became a steady drumbeat on Thorne's eardrums, driving him forward as he shuffled through the dusty space behind Sarah's figure in his haze of memories. He couldn't get the scent of her perfume from hours ago off his skin, nor could he shake the feeling that she was just out of reach, like trying to grasp smoke.</p>
<p>A photograph half-pressed into the dusty surface stared back at him, worn and creased, with a face he recognized yet didn't quite belong to his. The eyes were familiar, the shape, the curve of her eyelids when the light hit it wrong, but this was Emily, not Sarah. Yet here she was.</p>
<p>Thorne's mind reeled as if trying to untangle the very fabric of his existence. This was where memories went wrong, their own narrative, no longer under his control. Every door led to more questions than answers. The echoes of an argument with his wife whispered through walls that weren't quite there yet, and the taste of forgotten wine on his lips reminded him of how far away he'd slipped.</p>
<p>In a cold sweat, Thorne turned the photograph over. There was no backside; only a message scribbled in what looked like his own handwriting, a child’s drawing. It was bold charcoal marks, full of unsteady joy and pain so raw it bled through the surface of him.</p>
<p>&quot;You really were here, weren’t you?&quot; Thorne whispered aloud, as if asking for proof instead of understanding.</p>
<p>Sarah or Emily? The name blurred within him like a forgotten recipe, too familiar to remember why. He knew she wanted something; her presence had shifted realities until what was possible was no longer the norm. Reality's doorframe seemed to have warped in half, opening onto places that were his but didn’t belong, revealing pieces of lives he thought belonged solely to others.</p>
<p>It dawned on him then: how could his own memories unravel so they looked new again? How could people and things from stories or photographs come back to live their lives alongside him? The world turned its face toward madness when someone dared challenge it, a story said only in whispers around campfires, in moonlit bars where darkness held court.</p>
<p>He stumbled away from the photograph until he collapsed into one of the old armchairs near a door, now open at a full-gutted crotch. Dust fluttered out in fine wisps that swirled once before settling back onto the broken floorboards like someone's regret. Thorne rubbed his tired eyes as if trying to see things that weren’t.</p>
<p>The silence inside was deafening. Even time itself wasn't holding on to its steady beat, instead, it wove together fragmented beats of past and present in an almost hypnotic cadence, urging him toward whatever awaited next. Outside the open door, rain seeped under windows like someone’s tears, a relentless reminder that this world he now inhabited no longer followed any simple rules.</p>
<p>&quot;I was left for dead,&quot; Thorne whispered, letting those words sink into himself as easily as salt would into mud. &quot;I thought I could die and leave it all behind but...no.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's your name?&quot; A voice echoed from just beyond the doorframe, hesitant, like he was testing to see if this version of reality existed at all.</p>
<p>Thorne blinked several times before his focus snapped back onto what was directly in front of him. There she stood, with her arms spread wide as if searching for someone or something, and he knew that face, those eyes; he’d seen them countless times but couldn't remember where, who it belonged to.</p>
<p>&quot;Emily?&quot; Thorne asked, a hint of uncertainty creeping into his voice, like the hesitation in hers. &quot;Am I...was Emily?&quot;</p>
<p>She didn’t laugh at him or smile knowingly, instead, she blinked twice as if trying to clear her vision before speaking, her words falling softly on this fragile bridge between past and present.</p>
<p>&quot;Thorne? Thorne?&quot; The voice was still tentative, unsure what it wanted but needing something from the man whose name was etched in his own memory like a scar on tender skin.</p>
<p>There was no response. Instead, Emily took another step closer, into a space that shouldn’t exist. Her hand extended toward him as if reaching across a chasm between worlds, and Thorne raised both arms to block out the storm outside - but for her fingers.</p>
<p>His heart pounded hard in his chest like a second beat trying to match the one he was already on. Slowly, hesitantly, he let his arms drop. His eyes locked on hers, searching something there that he desperately needed to find. Thorne's fingers wobbled as he let Emily's hands slide through his grasp, like the fragile first tentative reaches of a newborn bird learning to fly. Her touch was a spark that ignited a small fire in his chest, warmth spreading from the center outwards, chasing away the lingering chill of rain-soaked despair.</p>
<p>The storm outside subsided slightly, its turbulent rhythm gradually synchronizing with Thorne's racing heartbeat. He blinked once, twice, focusing on Emily's face as it swirled around him like a veil, allowing glimpses of memories he'd rather forget.</p>
<p>Emily took another step, her movements fluid and deliberate, as if navigating an underwater path she knew all too well. Her eyes never left his, two dark pools drawing him in with secrets hidden beneath their waves-like depths. The silence between them had grown quieter still, a delicate thing requiring only Thorne's most subtle response to sustain.</p>
<p>Her gaze slid down to the floor near where Emily stood, then snapped back up to Thorne’s face; a moment of pause hung before she began speaking, and for that instant, as if the universe held its breath, Thorne could sense it.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you remember?&quot; Emily’s whisper was so delicate, she almost sounded as though she feared shattering it by moving her voice one syllable further.</p>
<p>Her question tugged at a thread of recoll ection in his mind; tugged enough that some part of him wondered if maybe the threads really were frayed enough to unravel now. It didn't hurt when memories resurfaced, usually but that was this time, somehow distinctly different.</p>
<p>Thorne's gaze darted around them as he tried to recall what pieces existed in common with her memories, but for a moment, there was simply an unspoken understanding: this version of himself knew things the other wasn’t familiar with; it would have been foolish not to think they shared some form of bond in their current reality.</p>
<p>His voice cracked slightly. “Sarah.”</p>
<p>The word felt as though he breathed out its syllables instead of saying them like they were another person’s name, but every time his lips formed &quot;S-a-r-a-h,&quot; memories resurfaced with the strength of autumn rain - and for a second there was no room between 'Sarah' and Thorne. When it faded again, Emily stepped back, her eyes still fixed on his face as she began to ask another question with a hint of desperation creeping into it.</p>
<p>What did he want? What purpose could any name possibly serve in understanding why this reality twisted around its axis at such erratic speed if the very people inhabiting it couldn't hold onto any semblance of order?</p>
<p>Time seemed to take on an existence all its own when Thorne thought back; that thread unraveled further. With an air of resignation, as though knowing his next line would be a blow to someone - he took a hesitant step closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Innsmouth,&quot; he said, choosing each word carefully like selecting keys from a damaged piano.</p>
<p>Emily's eyes slid past and beyond the figure in front of her before refocusing on him once more. She raised an eyebrow - but there was only silence for another second when she began to speak again; softer this time, softer as it sliced away like crystal.</p>
<p>“Thorn's the name that comes with those questions,&quot; Emily whispered back, but Thorne could see something there; behind the veils of his past - a hint of longing and, if anything else, love.</p>
<p>Yet for what purpose? Love didn’t explain an existence suspended in some state between what was real and the other unknown world she claimed to inhabit. Maybe they wanted answers that lay where reality made sense because then it held more potential than ever the unknown ever did.</p>
<p>Emily closed her eyes.</p>
<p>There were sounds coming - just beyond his range, muffled with layers of distance, whispers calling from an edge Thorne thought he knew but now refused to touch for fear.</p>
