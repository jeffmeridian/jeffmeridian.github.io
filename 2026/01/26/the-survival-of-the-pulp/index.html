<p>If you walk into a German train station today, you can still buy a brand-new adventure of a ghost hunter or a space traveler for a few Euros. To an American or a Frenchman, this feels like a time machine. While the &quot;Pulp&quot; era began as a global movement, each country took a different path into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Germany: The Eternal Kiosk<br>
Germany is the undisputed champion of the modern &quot;booklet novel.&quot; While other countries moved these stories into thick paperbacks or digital archives, the German Heftroman stayed exactly where it started: at the kiosk.</p>
<p>The Past: Post-war Germany had a hunger for escapism. Series like Jerry Cotton (FBI stories) became so popular they sold millions of copies weekly. In 1961, Perry Rhodan was launched as a short &quot;space opera&quot; series; it was only meant to last 30 issues, but it never stopped.</p>
<p>The Present: Germany is the only place where the &quot;weekly serial&quot; is still a mass-market reality. You noticed them in the cigarette shops and kiosks—this &quot;Kiosk-Kultur&quot; is the lifeblood of the genre. Today, Bastei Lübbe and Pabel-Moewig keep legends like John Sinclair and Perry Rhodan alive, moving beyond the kiosk into specialized e-book subscriptions and massive audio-drama productions.</p>
<p>Spain: The Era of the &quot;Bolsilibro&quot;<br>
In Spain, the pulp tradition was defined by the Bolsilibro—tiny, pocket-sized books that were often traded in barbershops or street markets.</p>
<p>The Past: During the 1950s and 60s, publishers like Editorial Bruguera dominated the Spanish-speaking world. Authors like Corín Tellado (the queen of romance) and George H. White (sci-fi) wrote at a lightning pace. These were &quot;swap-culture&quot; books; you’d buy one, read it on the bus, and trade it at a second-hand stall for the next one.</p>
<p>The Present: The weekly kiosk model collapsed in Spain in the 1990s. However, there is a massive &quot;nostalgia market&quot; today. Small &quot;micro-publishers&quot; are now releasing new Bolsilibros in the classic 10x15cm format to satisfy collectors who miss the gritty, fast-paced style of the old days.</p>
<p>France: From &quot;Feuilletons&quot; to High Fantasy<br>
France has a long history of &quot;serial fiction,&quot; but they were the first to &quot;elevate&quot; it from cheap booklets into something more permanent.</p>
<p>The Past: France invented the feuilleton—stories published chapter-by-chapter in daily newspapers. Legends like Fantômas (the masked criminal) were the French equivalent of pulp heroes. In the mid-20th century, series like Fleuve Noir (black river) published thousands of sci-fi and crime stories in a small paperback format called &quot;Anticipation.&quot;</p>
<p>The Present: France moved away from the &quot;thin booklet&quot; faster than Germany. Today, the French &quot;pulp&quot; spirit lives on in Bandes Dessinées (Graphic Novels) and high-quality mass-market paperbacks. While you won't see as many thin booklets at the kiosk, French readers are among the world's biggest consumers of serialized manga and fantasy novels.</p>
<p>USA: The Birthplace of the &quot;Pulp&quot;<br>
The United States is where it all began with the Dime Novel and the Pulp Magazine, but it is also where the original format died the hardest.</p>
<p>The Past: In the 1930s, characters like The Shadow, Doc Savage, and Conan the Barbarian ruled the newsstands. These were printed on &quot;pulp&quot; (cheap wood-pulp paper), hence the name. They were the direct ancestors of the modern superhero comic book.</p>
<p>The Present: By the 1950s, the &quot;Pulp Magazine&quot; was replaced by the mass-market paperback and television. Today, the US &quot;Pulp&quot; scene is almost entirely digital or high-end. While you can't buy a weekly Doc Savage booklet at a gas station anymore, the stories have moved to Hollywood—nearly every major Marvel or DC movie is just a high-budget version of a 1930s pulp story.</p>
<p>Summary: Where to find the &quot;Soul&quot; of the Pulp today?<br>
Germany: At the Kiosk (The last place where the thin booklet is king).</p>
<p>Spain: At Second-hand markets or specialty &quot;Pulp&quot; boutiques.</p>
<p>France: In the BD (Graphic Novel) section of the bookstore.</p>
<p>USA: In the Cinema or on a Kindle.</p>
<p>These booklets have very specific &quot;blueprints&quot; that make them recognizable instantly. Whether they are the Heftromane you saw in the German cigarette shops or the Bolsilibros of Spain, they are designed for &quot;pulp speed&quot;—fast to write, fast to read, and cheap to buy.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of their physical and literary &quot;anatomy.&quot;</p>
<p>Germany: The Heftroman (The &quot;Dime Novel&quot;)<br>
The ones you see at the kiosk are almost always in DIN A5 or DIN A4 (magazine) format.</p>
<p>Dimensions: Usually 15.5 x 22.5 cm (standard) or 21 x 29.7 cm (large format). They are very thin, usually just 64 pages.</p>
<p>Word Count: Between 20,000 and 25,000 words. A professional author is expected to write one entire booklet in a week.</p>
<p>Famous Authors:</p>
<p>Helmut Rellergerd (Jason Dark): The creator of John Sinclair. He wrote over 1,000 of these booklets personally.</p>
<p>K.H. Scheer &amp; Clark Darlton: The architects of Perry Rhodan. They created a &quot;series bible&quot; so complex it has its own fan-run encyclopedia (Perrypedia).</p>
<p>Heinz Werner Höber: The most prolific writer for Jerry Cotton. He once calculated he had written over 200 &quot;Cotton&quot; novels.</p>
<p>Spain: The Bolsilibro (The &quot;Pocket Book&quot;)<br>
These were much smaller than the German ones—literally designed to fit into a worker's jacket pocket.</p>
<p>Dimensions: Usually 10.5 x 15 cm. They looked like tiny, thick bricks rather than thin magazines.</p>
<p>Word Count: About 20,000 to 30,000 words, spanning roughly 96 to 128 small pages.</p>
<p>Famous Authors:</p>
<p>Corín Tellado: The &quot;Queen of Romance.&quot; She wrote over 4,000 novels and is listed in the Guinness World Records.</p>
<p>Francisco González Ledesma (Silver Kane): A high-profile lawyer and journalist by day, he wrote hundreds of gritty Westerns and Crime stories by night to support his family.</p>
<p>Antonio Vera Ramírez (Lou Carrigan): Famous for the Brigade Central series and over 1,000 other pulps.</p>
<p>USA: The Classic Pulps<br>
The American pulps were larger and more like thick magazines before they transitioned to the &quot;mass-market paperback.&quot;</p>
<p>Dimensions: The &quot;Standard Pulp&quot; was 7 x 10 inches (approx. 18 x 25 cm). They were thick, often 128 pages.</p>
<p>Word Count: A single pulp magazine often contained one &quot;Lead Novel&quot; of 30,000–40,000 words, plus several short stories, totaling about 65,000 words per issue.</p>
<p>Famous Authors:</p>
<p>Lester Dent (Kenneth Robeson): The man behind Doc Savage. He had a famous &quot;Master Fiction Plot&quot; formula for writing 6,000 words a day.</p>
<p>Robert E. Howard: The creator of Conan the Barbarian. He sent his stories from a small town in Texas to the big pulp magazines in New York.</p>
<p>France: Fleuve Noir &amp; Anticipation<br>
France preferred a slightly more &quot;elegant&quot; paperback look even for their cheap thrillers.</p>
<p>Dimensions: 11 x 17.5 cm (The &quot;Petit Format&quot;).</p>
<p>Word Count: Usually longer than the German booklets, ranging from 35,000 to 45,000 words.</p>
<p>Famous Authors:</p>
<p>Stefan Wul: A dentist by profession who wrote some of the most imaginative French Sci-Fi pulps like Oms en série (which became the film Fantastic Planet).</p>
<p>Jean-Gaston Vandel: A pseudonym for two brothers who wrote over 80 Sci-Fi novels for the famous Anticipation line.</p>
<p>The &quot;Pulp Speed&quot; Comparison<br>
Country	Format Name	Typical Word Count	Vibe<br>
Germany	Heftroman	22,000	Weekly serial, thin, magazine-style paper.<br>
Spain	Bolsilibro	25,000	Tiny &quot;pocket&quot; bricks, very colorful covers.<br>
USA	Pulp Magazine	40,000+	Rough, yellowish paper, high-octane art.<br>
France	Petit Format	40,000	Small paperback, often sci-fi or spy noir.</p>
