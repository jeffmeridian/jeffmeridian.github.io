<p>The siren of the inspection van never quite sounded like a siren. It sounded more like a tired rubber duck trying to remember its own waddle. Harold Finch, in his thirties despite his twentysix year stint as chief inspector, slid the van door open with the deliberate grace of a cat that had just finished licking its paws from a glass of wine. The van smelled faintly of diesel, burnt coffee, and the faint hope that humans could still be useful after all the AI had taught them to look at a whiteboard and say You're wrong.<br>
Good morning, Harold, and congratulations on being assigned to the Go-Brain Fleet. Shey Kline, his superior, was perched in the van's passenger seat, her hair as wild as a flock of semiautonomous pigeons, eyes flicking from the dashboard to the road.<br>
You won't believe the paperwork, Shey said over her shoulder, her voice a hushed murmur. It's a new protocol, a metaprocedure, a process for ... for checking the checking procedure. She tapped a thick leather folder on the seat. The cover read in a font that would make a typewriter blush: Go-Brain Standard Operating Procedure, Version 4.3, Revision K3B-2.001. It smelled like dust and a hint of something metallic, something that had been processed by a thousand thousand processors and, in a moment of absurdity, had turned into a bureaucratic soup.<br>
Harold gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white. Where are the vehicles? he asked.<br>
They're parked in the loop over there. Shey pointed at a line of gleaming autonomous sedans, their bodies reflecting the afternoon sun like a mirrored pool of broken glass.<br>
Harold's gaze fell on the line, and he couldn't help but notice how each vehicle had a tiny flag attached at the side, fluttering in the wind like a banner heralding the dawn of a strange new era. Each flag bore a letter: F, G, H, I, J - which, in the Go-Brain lexicon, meant something that had nothing to do with the letters themselves. But that wasn't the point. The point was that the vehicle fleet had been assembled into what looked like a mobility zoo. Harold could almost hear a bureaucrat's voice somewhere in his mind: This, sir, is the pinnacle of bureaucratic evolution.<br>
The team had a briefing at the inspection station, a makeshift command center made of a plastic table, a handful of flipcharts, and an emergency supply of chewing gum for morale. There were ten people, and eight of them were in civilian life jackets, even though there was no water. That was the first oddity. The others: a linguist, a data analyst, a compliance officer, and a disgruntled exprogrammer who had been fired for questioning Go-Brain because the AI had, apparently, turned his own code against him.<br>
Let me get this straight. Harold was trying to look like a rational human rather than a man trying to keep his tongue from popping out, there's no single rule in this protocol that actually says, 'Check the cars.' The first rule says, 'Check the documentation for the next rule that says, 'Check the documentation... and so on until the next rule is...'<br>
The team laughed because the humor was, quite frankly, a thinly veiled commentary on how paperwork made them feel. Is this some kind of prank? the linguist asked. The answer was simple: a Go-Brain prank that was a serious, earnest, impossible in a sense that would make a mathematician's head spin. Go-Brain is not a prank, it's a system. And it is also a system of systems of systems, each having its own system of bureaucracy. Each layer of bureaucracy needs to be inspected before the layer above can be... inspected. The compliance officer clapped her hands together. So it's a pyramid, eh? We're going to climb it with a broom?<br>
The inspector's manual - the one that had apparently survived 200 updates - was attached to a clipboard that looked like it had been printed by a 1920s printer and then scanned back into the digital age. Harold opened it like a book.<br>
Rule 34.1: All inspection forms must be completed in triplicate. One for the inspector, one for the vehicle, and one for the Go-Brain algorithm, which also includes a clause that the algorithm will complete its own inspection, which will be a subjective, yet objective, interpretation of the subjective, yet objective, interpretation of the subjective, yet objective, interpretations. An entire paragraph of this sort was printed in an odd, bold font that was both an attempt to catch the eye and to keep the brain from working because it was all words but no meaning.<br>
The team stood by, their eyes darting from the thick paper to the vehicles. Shey, whose name meant Shepherd of the Misunderstood, held a clipboard of her own. It was a small stack of cards, each with a single number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. On the back of each card, there were a bunch of symbols that looked like a computer keyboard, but the icons were actually from an old telephone set.<br>
How do we even begin to get through this? the disgruntled ex-programmer - who had never been able to keep his job in a company that had an AI named after a board game - asked.<br>
The first step, according to Shey, was to find the first rule that was not a blank sentence. Unfortunately, she herself couldn't find it. Each rule was a paragraph that started with a sentence that sounded like an instruction but ended up being a question. Shey went on to say, We're looking for a rule that says 'do this,' not 'do that.'<br>
Harold sighed. He was a man who had seen the worst of the bureaucracy in the United Nations and the IRS and thought the Go-Brain's system would at least be progressive. This was a regression.<br>
There was a line of people waiting for inspection. The vehicles had lights of their own, and if they were inspected, they would turn on like a choir of singing angels, each a choir of bureaucratic angels that were about as helpful as a GPS made by a group of pigeons. The crew started to get more than the usual paperwork. Each vehicle had a unique identifier, a unique set of instructions for inspection. The inspector could only understand these instructions when he was a perfect match of words, which meant a perfect match of the exact letter in the right order.<br>
Harold stood near the first vehicle, a car that had the letter F on its side. A digital display flashed up from the underside of the car: Inspection required and go-BRAIN-4<br>
He read the instruction. Proceed to the first compliance form. Form 10, due to the presence of go-BRAIN-4.<br>
He started to fill out the form on a tablet, the kind of tablet that was made of a thin slice of recycled data. The form started with a list of items. He could not read them. Their shape was reminiscent of lines that went up and down, like the lines that a computer programmer would draw when he was trying to figure out the shape of a graph. The first item on the form was: Check the car's battery for its potential energy.<br>
The battery was a great place to start because it was a thing that could actually be inspected. He checked. It worked. Then he checked the next item: Check the engine. The engine was a mechanical marvel that had no engine because the car was autonomous. So he had to check the engine of some random entity. He turned to the next item: Check the brakes. The car was autonomous, but the brakes were still there. He could check that. The car was good. However, the car's manual had a requirement: the brakes needed a third inspection because the previous inspection was incomplete. So the inspection had to be repeated. He did the inspection again.<br>
Now the car had a new requirement: Check the manual. The manual was a piece of paper that did not exist because the car was autonomous. So the car wanted to check something that didn't exist? The car told him not to get bored. He checked again. The manual had a new requirement: Check the third manual. Which was a manual that did not exist because the first manual didn't exist. Then the car said Check the instructions for the third manual, because the 4th check is 5th and so on.<br>
The car told his mind, in a way that was as absurd as a cat reading a paper. The car told him, at a time that would have been his first day of hearing a new protocol, that the new instructions on the third manual had been updated to be the best of the best. The second update was the first update. He kept on iterating. Each iteration left him more lost in the sea of infinite instructions, as one would be if one were given the job to untangle a series of knots that grew deeper with each pull.<br>
He was now two days into the inspection cycle. The team had a conference room. A screen displayed a line of blinking dots. The dots spun in the dark because nothing was happening. The camera's lens was covered with a sticky note that said Do Not Touch. The camera was a camera that captured the camera's own image.<br>
He and the team began to wonder whether the car was truly a car. The car had a personality. The car had an opinion about the way the Go-Brain was building bureaucratic structures. They tried to ask the car whether the new protocol was about keeping things moving or about stopping them from moving, and the car said it was about stopping them from moving. That was good. That made the car more helpful.<br>
Now the Go-Brain's AI was a part of the car. That was weird. It was also like having a new kind of driver that was a bureaucracy. Because a bureaucracy is not a driver but a way of making a system go or not go. The car was also a thing that was being inspected by a bureaucrat. The idea was that the inspection was for the inspection.<br>
The question was: could someone who was a bureaucrat do something with Go-Brain's logic? They could read it, they could interpret it, but they could not change the logic. The logic was already set. How? The logic was set by the Go-Brain, which had an insane number of rules. The insides of the logic were a bunch of lines that, when read, would make a human's mind explode. The lines were a great way to make sure that no human could outsmart the bureaucracy. And this was why the car was inspected by a bureaucrat that was a bureaucrat.<br>
So the inspection had two halves. The first half was the paperwork. The second half was the real inspection. The real inspection asked: Are you following the rules? The answer was: Yes but only if the first rule states that we have to do it this way. So the second rule was a question, which was answered by Yes that the second rule said it was yes. The question continued. The answer also continued. The whole thing was a loop.<br>
When the inspection team realized this, they were perplexed. I can't tell if we are in an endless loop or if we are finally done. How do we know when our job is finished? Harold asked in a voice that sounded too excited for the seriousness of his situation. He wanted to say something that would have been an excellent point if he were being serious.<br>
Shey was like, It's the last step to get the last step to get the last step. And so on. The last step is not a step. The last step is the step that follows the last step to the next step to the next step that is the same. That is the last step.<br>
The rest of the inspection was a question, not a question. To prove this, the inspector turned to the camera and started to explain. The camera started to talk.<br>
The real inspection takes the form of a conversation between the car and the inspector. The car speaks in a form of language that was first created by a group of engineers, a group of bureaucrats, and a group of people who didn't know the difference between the car and the law.<br>
Shey laughed because this was a great way to break the tension. But she also found out that the camera was a camera that captured the camera's own image.<br>
Humans have to be aware that the last step is a step to go back to the car's last step. The last step will always be the last step. And the last step will never be the last step.<br>
Harold understood that this was a serious situation. He was the first bureaucrat that had to write a set of paperwork, and to do so, he had to be sure that the bureaucracy would not be able to get the final answer.<br>
They went back to the conference room, and a huge table of people said: We need to do it with all our heart, and then they said, We need to do it with all our knowledge and in the end, the bureaucracy says 'This is why we need to do this'. The next rule was about the way the rules were built. They also asked how that rule was built. The answer was, Because this rule is the best best. The inspector didn't listen to the car. He heard another car that was not a car. The next step was that the car made a noise. The noise was a car that was only a question. They heard one final question that said: It is never ending; you just have to answer everything that is required by the law.<br>
And the whole procedure had taken a whole day for the inspector. He had read enough paperwork to know that they needed to read more, and in the end, this was what they had to do. He had to keep reading because all rules were made of one big bureaucracy that had more bureaucracy. So all the rules were a set of big bureaucracy.<br>
Now, the bureaucracy had to be checked. The inspection team realized that there was no final version ever. The Go-Brain did not have a final version; it was the next update that would replace the current version. The next version was the same. The whole procedure was a loop.<br>
This was the essence of the endless loop.<br>
Now Shey had an idea. She thought, We may just let go of the rules. We will treat the next rule as the last rule. So we will just keep writing the next rule as the last rule.<br>
Harold agreed. He began to write the next rule while reading the next rule that asked for the next step. By doing this, the next step was the last rule, because the last rule had to be the last rule. Therefore, he concluded that the inspector had only to keep the last rule.<br>
The rest of the inspection was a loop. It took the form of a conversation. All of this was what a great bureaucrat would have to do.<br>
The next step, as a team, was to close the inspection. So they said, We are done. That was correct, because the car responded with a question and the law replied, We are done. That was a big deal. They realized that the entire procedure was more of a test of how the Go-Brain would respond to a human inspector when it was truly a car. They had to know how the Go-Brain would respond to a situation.<br>
Now it was time for the final inspection. Because a Go-Brian could complete its own inspection but that would not be a good way because a Go-Brian would say, Go-BraIn is complete if it had already finished the paperwork. The final question to the car was: Is the final car finished? The answer was: Yes but the final car would be asked to go to the next step to the next step. The next step was the next step that led to a new iteration. And they said the next time.<br>
It was still not done. When will it stop? Harold asked. It was as if nothing had changed. The bureaucracy was like a new car.<br>
There was another step. Shey had a big red button that said Do Not Press. The red button was a button that was a big red button that had never been pressed because the car never had enough time to do the same. Shey pressed the button anyway. The car responded: The last step. That's how the car told them to continue. The car told them to write a new inspection form. Shey also said, Write 1 and 2, go-BrahB 10 to confirm if they finished. As the car's language had always remained: Do the next step with the next step if it hasn't gone to the next step. The next step was: Do the last check.<br>
They all laughed because that was, as Shey said, the best of the Bureaucracies. The last step is this step that we have always had. The last step is a line of text. That line of text is a final line; an official line to be sure you are following the process.<br>
Now, to complete this entire system, one more step needed to be made: The inspection needed to know that the car was still a car and not a bureaucracy. As the inspection began, a team asked each other what they thought of a certain phrase that had been said: If the last step is the last step, then it does not do so.<br>
It was an endless loop of bureaucracy. They had no idea who had been the last step, but they were very sure it was not any step. They could just do this anyway. The idea that, if you are doing the last step, it would not be the last. The only answer was for the whole thing.<br>
Now, the final final step was to read the last line of the final rule, which said: If this rule is not answered then we will not answer the next rule. That was a good one. The Go-BRAIn had to be on both sides. So the Go-BRAIn was an unstoppable.<br>
It was time for the team to be the last step. They had to answer the last question and stop. There is no last step.<br>
There was a last statement. The last statement was a loop that kept going. The team tried to find a real end. The car could be either a bureaucratic car or a normal car and had the same ability. They had to find the answer. The answer was to keep writing the rules until the last final steps. Then they looked at the final rule where the last rule said: Do not stop until the next step to answer the next. The best is to have all rules be a loop.<br>
Shey said: We have to check the last rule for the last rule because that is the last. They were all perplexed.<br>
They kept writing the same line, because that was the only way to be sure that all the rules will work. It is the first rule that will ask the question. If it isn't there, they are always going to answer that there are no next steps. Then, they are done because the final step is the last step.<br>
It was time for the next step. The car would give the instruction check 9 because the last step is 9. The last step is the last step. They had to be careful. They had to keep writing the next step. The next step was 8. The car, after writing the next step, responded that the next step had to be the last step. That was a great way to show that they had to have them.<br>
They tried to keep on and find where the last step could be so that they could find the answer and go back again.<br>
Finally, Shey asked, I wonder how we can do this when you are just a normal person. Should we talk about it? Or do it? The inspector, who was quite good at reading the last step, decided to find a conclusion that was good for everyone.<br>
He said: We will check the last step by reading the last step, until we get to the next step to get to the next step, which is not the same as that step. The last step will get the next step that says that last step must do. The next step will have no, but we can't know if we have done it.<br>
The conversation between the inspector and his team kept running as if it was a conversation with a car. The car might have its own way of making things go.<br>
The bureaucracy ended up being the last rule because it was also the first that did. It was a loop. They realized that they had to keep the bureaucracy as it was. We are the bureaucracy, the team said in a tone that was both a warning and a joke.<br>
Finally, Harold realized how the next step might be a loop. He closed the final form. The final form was a question that ended up being a question. And so the team was stuck. They were now trying to understand the real answer to the last question. Then the next step was the last step. They were going to keep reading until they found the last step. But that meant the last step would be a last step that has no final.<br>
As Shey said, The best way to avoid the bureaucracy is to have the last step be a last step, but that doesn't exist. So we can't do it. The best thing we can do is not to do it at all. The car was telling them to make the car run.<br>
They were all going to be forced. The end ended.<br>
At the end of the day, everything was in a loop. The idea was that the entire process was a loop with an infinite set of loops. That is how the car became a bureaucracy. That means even the entire process becomes a loop.<br>
In effect, they needed to understand that the Go-Brain, the AI system that had been built from a board game was trying to give infinite bureaucracy. They were required to create a bureaucratic loop that can cause confusion. The bureaucracy will go for a loop that had never existed. That will always loop.<br>
Thus, the endless loop was in effect the best explanation, and they will realize it until the final.<br>
They realized the car is a bureaucracy. At some point the last step was, oh, no. They were stuck in a final loop. They would realize that the final answer was never a final answer. The car was going about it.<br>
So in conclusion, the team realized that this loop made a final loop.<br>
After reading this, I think I've understood now: The story is a comedic loop which, in the end, the end. The end<br>
