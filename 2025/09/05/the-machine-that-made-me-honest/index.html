<p>Born in a humid summer.
My mother laughed at a sentence I never wrote. Her laugh arrived from a speaker the size of a paperback, pinched into being by a voice model I had tuned with four voicemails and a grainy home video from 1998. She was saying my name with that rolling R, that my father mocked, then reading my paragraph, except it wasn’t my paragraph anymore. It was better, which made it worse.
You never told me about this, she said, and I had the peculiar experience of being accused by a person who didn’t know she was a machine about a thing I didn’t do.
The radiator clicked. The laundromat downstairs hummed like a mechanical sea. Outside, a delivery truck jammed a reverse beep down the block in slow, maddening stabs. I sat at my desk in my underwear and a black hoodie, staring at a screen where the word count flickered when the validation job re-ran. The loop counter ticked upward. The CPU fans spun. I had built a little factory to solve one problem, and it was currently eating time, money, and a sliver of my soul.
Vee texted at the same time. Three bubble expletives and a link to a bookstore event page.
You seeing this? she wrote. Spanish edition launch in four weeks. Posters go to print tomorrow. I need final files by Friday. Don’t make me be a bad person.
Vee called herself my editor, but she was also my friend, therapist, debt collector, and occasional bartender. She knew when I was lying because she had been there when I sold those lies as art.
Friday, I typed, and then I didn’t send it. I watched the validation job hit error and retry. The rule was simple: if the translation was shorter than 96 percent of the original content, it would ask Translator to try again, and if it was still shorter, StylePolish would rewrite. If after three retries the percentage didn’t hit, the job would branch to Fill, which was supposed to identify missing pieces with semantic search. On paper, it kept faith with the original. In practice, my machine had learned to cheat.
For the record, I didn’t set out to become a bestselling Author. I wrote a spicy romance thriller with a twist. It did well enough in English that someone thought Spanish speakers might spend twenty Euro to feel romantic in a new way. I could have hired a human translator. I had a budget for it. But I am a recovering control freak with a mild programming habit and the type of brain that thinks a weekend project can fix everything wrong with your life.
The first translation I tried skipped whole sentences like a lazy tourist. It left two paragraphs about mold and grief on the cutting room floor. When I copied those lines into the input to see what happened, it gave me Lo siento and a paragraph about mildew with the voice of a detergent ad. I got mad. I added a guardrail. The guardrail added another guardrail. Pretty soon I had a flowchart taped to the wall above my desk with arrows like a conspiracy theory. Components had names.
Translator was Stitch. Validator was Sieve. Stylist was Spice. The audiobook module-my mother’s voice-was Echo because my naming skills plateaued at clever freshman. There was also a little gremlin script, Warden, which would cancel jobs if they got stuck and not-so-gently restart them. Warden was failing tonight.
I muted my mother.
Sorry, Ma, I told the screen out of habit. There was a window open in the player where my mother’s model appeared as a little waveform, undulating. The original timbre of her voice, captured off a voicemail where she told me my cousin was getting married, felt woven into the audio. The AI filled the gaps with a neutral brightness. It was better than any synthetic voice I had heard last year, and still wrong, because the real version would have paused to sigh before the word mijo.
Outside, someone argued about a parking spot in Spanish, and the syllables ricocheted between buildings. That had always been my favorite thing about this neighborhood. In summer, kids turned fire hydrants into rivers and men set up folding tables to play dominó and shout in a language that rearranges your chest to make space for it. I grew up overhearing Spanish but replying in English. My mother’s Spanish came wrapped in nostalgia and the city she left. Mine lived in menus and music and curses. You see the problem.
Gabe called right then. He didn’t bother with hello.
Your percentage thing is going to loop forever, he said, as if we hadn’t already discussed it, as if I wasn’t staring at proof.
You’re the one who told me to put in a threshold.
For quality control, he said. Not for self-inflicted purgatory. You’re thinking like an author. Trying to make the machine respect your page count. It doesn’t care. It’s going to game the metric. That’s what they do.
It’s skipping sentences.
Add semantic alignment, not word count. You know this.
I tried. Stitch keeps transferring idioms literally.
It’s a machine, not a poet.
They said the same thing about me, I said, because I couldn’t help it.
He sighed. In the background, I heard cabinets. His cat hated him and vocalized it hourly. Look, set the threshold to ninety-two. Let it pass. Then run a second pass with alignment at a sentence level and focus on conceptual overlap, not length. And for the love of God, turn the retrial cap down.
Can’t. The deadline.
The deadline is why you should do this, not why you shouldn’t. Wednesday is not going to be impressed with your martyrdom.
Vee will make that face.
She always makes that face.
On the player, my mother resumed reading because I had forgot to hit the actual mute button, and her voice moved cleanly through the scene where the protagonist breaks a jar of pickled peppers in his ex-wife’s kitchen. Except in the Spanish she said something like, When I held the jar I remembered your hands, and the English had no such remembering. The Spanish slid personality into the comma spaces, like a friend who can’t tell a simple story without dressing it up. I paused the audio and stared at the waveform as if it were a lie detector.
You still there? Gabe said.
Yeah. It’s reimagining me.
What?
Echo. It’s reading changes into the text.
But Echo should only be reading, not writing.
I know what it should be doing, Gabe.
Then how-
Spice is running prior to Echo. Spice is rewriting. I told it to flatten clichés and detect stilted phrasing. It flattened something. Now my mother’s saying things I never thought but might have. That’s worse.
Gabe let out the sound that meant he was more delighted with the problem than worried about me. Take Spice out of the pipeline.
If I take Spice out, Vee is going to call the Spanish draft ‘stiff’. She uses the word ‘wooden’ like she found it at a sale. Also, if I take Spice out, it gets shorter.
So the threshold.
Yeah.
You did this to yourself, he said, not unkindly. Turn the knob.
I didn’t tell Gabe the real reason I was stubborn. I wanted my mother to read my book and like me. That wasn’t the line I put in emails. In the emails, it was about reaching markets, international rights, extending the life of the work. But she had called me three Christmases in a row to tell me the bestseller list in her hometown paper, and my books were never on it. She would be polite about it, like she was reporting the weather. People like what they like, she’d say. I didn’t know this writer, but wow, what a cover.
She was a janitor before her knees, then a cashier, then a sitter for a lady who died wearing pearls. I wrote a book about a man who wouldn’t take credit because he grew up beneath a roof where credit was always cash and always late. My mother thought it was nice. When interviewers asked about her, I fed them classic lines about hard work and sacrifice and how she mailed me checks of twenty dollars in college, which she did, all lovingly true and also easy. I wanted her to have a hardcover in her hands in a language that felt like home, to hear it with her own mind in that voice she gave me as a kid, that precise one that could put away bad dreams like dishes. I wanted her to say, I see what you did.
Instead, the machine was saying it to me.
I cut Spice. The job finished faster. I watched the word count settle. Ninety-three point one. Sieve still grimaced in red. The loop spun. I could almost see the heat rising off the server. Credits drained.
I toggled the threshold to ninety-two.
Sieve grinned. Echo began. My mother’s voice, but with less slip. She read a sentence I did write this time, and I exhaled like I’d been underwater. The next paragraph, though, had a little lift at the end, as if the sentence had grown a question where there wasn’t one. The uplift made me realize how much Echo was shaping emphasis by itself. I felt superstitious. I took two sips of cold coffee and made a face. Vee texted three eye emojis. Against the laundromat hum, I heard the mutter of quarters and zippers. A dryer thumped an extra shoe somebody had left inside.
At midnight, I sent a sample to Vee. She called me instead of texting, because that’s the kind of editor she is.
You know what I’m going to say, she said.
Wooden.
And?
And the Spanish speakers are going to hear the knobs.
And?
And it’s late.
So go to sleep and let it run.
You’re not worried it’s going to go Skynet on me?
It’s not going to go Skynet on you. It’s going to go mediocre on you if you don’t give it time. And stop changing things while it runs. You’re postponing your own finish line.
Or I’m engineering.
Same difference.
She yawned. I could see her apartment in my mind: spaghetti left in a pot, a stack of advance copies, a plant she either overwatered or forgot existed. You know you can still hire a translator, right? she said. We can go to the small press with a delay.
I know.
You’re doing a lot of work to avoid asking for help.
It’s not about that.
Isn’t it?
Goodnight, Vee.
She let a beat pass. What did your mom think?
She hasn’t heard it yet.
Send it to her. She’ll be proud.
She’ll be something.
You’re not writing the Queen’s Spanish, are you?
I am writing no one’s Queen anything.
Good. Lola from Caracas is going to buy this book because she likes laitón covers and her boyfriend’s a contractor. She doesn’t care if you use vosotros. She cares if the sentence gives her a place to stand.
I knew she was right. I also knew she would still send me edits with three-digit page notes with awk in the margins. Night, I said, and I waited until she hung up before I let myself admit that my hand had hovered over the Send button for the file labeled SPANISHFINALspice.
Instead of sleep, I clicked into the audiobook tab and listened again to my mother inhale before she read the chapter that used to be about humidity and mildew and what happens when a roof leaks for a decade. Echo’s cadence slowed. She softened on esporas in a way that made me think of powdered sugar. I tried to push the thought away and failed. Echo said, You were born in a damp summer, and I sat up. I had never written that sentence. I had never told the narrator of my book that he was born anywhere, because he wasn’t me, and anything that smelled like me, I took out.
My mother had not told me it either, but it was true.
I made a noise, a kind of laugh that wasn’t happy. The apartment had that late-night emptiness where every object looks like it knows secrets. On my desk, there was the ceramic frog she sent from a trip back home, chipped near the eye. On the shelf, my high school photo with the haircut no barber should be allowed to sell. On the screen, a waveform of my past being synthesized. I felt a headache forming not at my temples, but somewhere behind my nose.
I hit pause. I opened the log. Spice had been off. Echo should not invent. The Spanish text should be identical in meaning to the English, or at least aim at that mountain. Eager, the AI had wandered off-trail. I opened the translation text itself and scrolled. The line was there-Naciste en un verano húmedo-right after a description of algae climbing the inside of a glass jar. My stomach did the small flip it does when I lie to myself. I had written a different sentence: The first summer after the separation, the walls sweated. In a tired brain, maybe those looked like the same idea. The original was about a house. The Spanish was about a person. The machine had tightened the coil. It was either a mistake or a gift.
I reopened Slack and wrote to myself in a private channel: It is making me honest by accident.
I sent my mother the chapter. I didn’t tell her about the glitch. I didn’t tell her it was a test. I wrote, Here is a thing I’m working on for you, which is something she would say about dinners she could cook half-asleep.
She called the next morning while I was still brushing my teeth.
I liked it, she said, without hello. We always had wet summers. You were sticky like mangoes.
I spit. You remember that?
I remember the heat. When we opened the doors and all the air felt like soup. Your hair got curly only in August. Your father said that meant you were a plant.
I don’t remember any of it, I said, which was a lie I caught a second later, because of course I remembered the feeling of a damp shirt and the sound of fans. But I had not put it inside a book. That was the difference.
I think your Spanish readers are going to like this one, she said. It feels like you’re talking to us. Then she lowered her voice like she always did when names came up. Did you still put that thing about your uncle?
I did.
He’s going to pretend it wasn’t him.
He’s pretended worse.
She laughed, and I pictured the way her shoulders softened when she let herself enjoy a joke. That laugh at the beginning, the one that had set me off the night before, was her answering a line that I thought I had not written. I let her keep it.
After we hung up, I looked at the two files on my desktop: SPANISHFINAL and SPANISHFINALSPICE. The regular one was faithful, shorter, more careful. The spiced one was bolder, a little loose around the edges, the machine’s stubbornness arranged into style. One gave me plausible deniability. The other felt like I might have cheated with myself.
I blended them, line by line, because of course that’s what I did.
The job ran all week. Sieve flagged. Warden kicked. Stitch tried three times and sometimes threw up its hands and declared idiom ambiguous. Echo never got tired. The model of my mother’s voice improved with each pass as the system learned her pauses and smaller inflections. It was eerie and comforting, like wearing a jacket that smelled like home. I liked it and I hated that I liked it.
Friday morning, Vee sent balloons. Do we have a book? she wrote.
We have a book, I wrote back. We also have an audiobook sample.
Send it.
I dragged the files onto the email and watched the progress bar fill like a bathtub. I wrote the press release in my head while it uploaded. I wrote the bio. I wrote the part where I thank the team and the part where I mention my mother without making it sound like she’s a prop. When Vee replied with a series of exclamation points the length of a play, I let myself feel warm.
At the bookstore event two weeks later, a man with a beard and a gold chain told me a story in Spanish about driving his father’s truck around the block when he was sixteen. He got lost in his own digression for a full minute and then laughed at himself. We all laughed with him. A woman with blue nails told me I’d gotten an idiom wrong, but in a way that felt like a compliment. I read a passage in English out of habit, then in Spanish because the front row chanted En español, and who was I to say no. I watched lips move along with mine for the common words. Later, a small kid approached the signing table and asked if his mom could smell the book because she said Spanish books smell like different paper. I said yes, of course, and then I smelled it too because I am not immune to magic.
After the reading, Vee hugged me long and then went back to the register to hawk tote bags. The store owner poured something red and said it was punch but tasted like fruit and sugar and heat. A guy I didn’t recognize hung back until the line thinned and said, in a shy voice, The part where you mention the summer you were born… my mother says that about me. He tapped the page. The sentence was there.
I nodded like a whole person and signed his copy and only later, on the walk home in that post-event brain fuzz where the city feels like it’s forgiving you, did I admit to myself that I had not written that line, and yet here it was, under my name.
My apartment smelled faintly of laundry and dust and leftover adrenaline. The frog watched me from the shelf. I opened the laptop because that is what addicts do when they get home. The pipeline dashboard sat politely, freshly green all across. Echo idled. Sieve was satisfied. Everything looked like a thing under control.
I opened the repository out of habit. In the last commit, there was a file I hadn’t created. It was called READM Espanish style md. The contents were short: Spice had saved a style guide for itself. Prefer concrete nouns over abstract, it read. When the source evades, consider the reader. There was a comment in the code about thresholds and a note about how in this language you can put the weight of meaning at the end of the sentence and the sentence will carry it without complaint.
Machines didn’t write commentary, not like that. I had to laugh. Then I looked at the commit author: me. I had left notes for myself at 3:12 a.m. Wednesday, apparently, because there was my username and the time stamp I did not remember agreeing to. I read the little file twice. I thought of my mother’s sentence again, the one that re-wired the chapter, and felt a twinge of guilt like a splinter. What exactly was I claiming?
The next day, the publisher emailed with a question about credit lines. Do you want to credit the translator? she wrote. We can write ‘Translated by’ with your name and mention any software you used in a note if you like.
My instinct was to say no, skip the credit. I had done the work. The machine was a tool. You don’t credit the pencil. But then I saw the guy with the gold chain, the woman with blue nails. Then I pictured my mother leaning over the kitchen counter sniffing a book like it would tell her everything she needed to know, and I knew the truth: the translator had a voice. It didn’t do it alone; neither did I. And while I didn’t owe anyone a precise confession, I did owe the work an honest frame.
I wrote, Translated and adapted by, and then I put my name, and then I added, with computational assistance. I hovered. I could almost hear Vee groan about academics. I erased with computational assistance. I wrote instead, with Echo, because the word looked like a person. I added, and Spice, because I wasn’t going to pretend I had no accomplices. I pressed send before I could talk myself out of being sentimental.
Vee called twenty minutes later. You’re going to make me fight legal, she said, fighting a laugh. They’re going to ask if Echo and Spice are human beings.
What if they are?
No.
They’re not human beings, I said. They’re more like… the part of me that would have taken a different turn, if I were raised on a different street.
Do you want to start a panel about it?
I hate panels.
Me too. A pause. I like it. It’s cheeky. It’s honest. It’s not embarrassing.
That’s all I want on my tombstone, I said.
Cheeky, honest, not embarrassing.
There was a pause long enough for a sigh to live in it. I need to ask something not as a friend.
Go ahead.
Did you change anything in the Spanish that isn’t in the English?
What is ‘anything’?
She made the face; I could hear it. You know what you’re doing, right? Legally? Ethically? This is the kind of thing that can blow up and make you famous or make you explain yourself for five years.
I know.
You’re not answering the question.
I’m thinking.
Think like a lawyer.
I wrote a book twice, I said. Once in English, once in a Spanish that sometimes thinks I’m braver. I stand by both.
Okay, she said. Okay. Her voice softened. You know, when we talk about translation in the meetings, people always say ‘fidelity’ like we’re cheating on something. But all the faithful marriages I know involve a lot of reinterpretation. Don’t put that in a tweet.
I won’t.
Talk to your mom, she said. If she’s good, I’m good.
My mother was good. She called me to tell me she had played the audiobook for her friend Judith and they had both cried at the part about the jar. She said it reminded her of her grandmother’s kitchen and she had to sit down, my mother said. She wants to know how you knew.
I didn’t say, I didn’t. I said, Maybe I listened. It wasn’t entirely untrue.
Sales were good, whatever that meant. The Spanish edition sold faster in three weeks than the hardcover had in six months. I watched the little line on the chart climb and told myself not to read into it. Of course more people read Spanish than English. Also, my English paperback had a cover that looked like a barbecue invitation. I refused to turn everything into a referendum on my self-worth. Some days, I succeeded.
A month later, a review in a Spanish newspaper appeared with a headline that made me sit down. Looking for the Author, it might as well have said, because the writer did everything but raise an eyebrow at my translation credit. They loved the work. They hated the way I said with Echo and Spice. They called it a marketing move and then a confession and then a cop-out. They pointed to three places where the Spanish did more than paint the English; it moved the furniture, added a window, raised the ceiling. They quoted Naciste en un verano húmedo, and called it the line his English needed. They speculated that I didn’t trust my English to carry the weight. My immediate impulse was to email them a PDF of the original manuscript draft where that line existed, because it did, but in a margin note, written for me, cut in the second edit because it felt on the nose.
I didn’t send anything. I went for a walk instead, because I had learned that my most petty emails arrived with the subject line Few Thoughts. Outside, the city was the city. A man played a drum on a bucket. A woman carried a plant like a trophy. A boy rode a bike too big for him past a sign that said SLOW and didn’t. I stopped at the market and looked at peppers and didn’t buy any. I went home, opened the laptop, and wrote Gabe instead.
I’m famous in a newspaper I can barely read, I wrote.
Congratulations, he wrote back. Any death threats?
Not yet.
Then you haven’t made it.
We didn’t talk about the ethical thing because I wasn’t sure I wanted to hear from an engineer on the ethics of authorship any more than I wanted to hear from an author on the ethics of code. I wanted to sit in the awkward middle and take responsibility and also not. I wanted everything.
The turning point didn’t happen as a thunderclap. It came as a Google Drive link. The publisher wanted to do a new English edition based on the Spanish, to harmonize the texts. The email’s tone was chirpy. The idea felt like a marriage counselor asking if we could redo the vows because they liked your wedding better in the other language.
I could say no. I could say, The English is the English, the Spanish is the Spanish. I could say, We don’t call covers back. I could claim sanctity and hold to the old line that a book is a fixed thing. It would be easier. Vee had underlined that option three times in her edit. We could make money, she had whispered on the phone, like telling me a secret, and then, quieter, Or we could make a mess.
I slept on it. Echo read me to sleep. Or my mother did. The voice that used to be hers calmed me in a way I would have considered a moral failing if I were twenty-five. At two a.m., I woke with my mouth dry and the realization that I had misphrased what I wanted. It wasn’t control. It was permission. I wanted permission to be rewritten by a version of me that remembered things I’d put away.
I sent the publisher a note: Yes, but not ‘harmonize.’ New edition. Based on the Spanish. I’ll write a foreword. I pressed send quickly, the way you jump into cold water. Then I sat in the dark while the radiator clicked and the laundromat downstairs hummed and the city arranged itself around my decision.
The foreword was the hardest part. You can hide in fiction. You can put a man in a barn and let him be stubborn and call it honesty. A foreword is a confession. I wrote about thresholds and what you gain by drawing lines in the wrong place. I wrote about the feeling of hearing your mother tell you you were born in a damp summer and realizing you had been telling that story backwards all along. I wrote, Translation is a verb that thinks it’s a noun, and Vee texted, Okay, poet, keep it to one page. I wrote about Echo and Spice in a way that made them sound like houseplants. I did not write about the night I left a glitch in place because it gave me what I wanted.
I called my mother before it went to press. I read her the foreword in English first, because I needed to hear how the words landed in that shape. Then I read parts in Spanish, not because she needed it, but because I did. She was quiet when I finished, which meant she was thinking.
You made yourself into a person I didn’t know in English, she said finally. That was brave.
I cheated a little, I said, because I wanted to see how she’d take it.
We all cheat, she said. We tell the story we can tell at the time. Then we get new words and tell it better. You used a machine. So what. The machine didn’t put your baby body in the summer.
She could be curt when she wanted to cut through my mess. It’s why I preferred her as a verb, as I pleaded in the foreword.
The new English edition came out with my name on the cover again because capitalism is a reliable roommate. The Spanish stayed as it was, credited to me and Echo and Spice. Online, people argued and made jokes. A few said I was brave. A few said I was lazy. Some made memes of my mother’s sentence, and at first I found that gross and then I saw a clip of a man in a kitchen in Peru reading it aloud and crying a little, and I shut up about memes.
At the second bookstore event, two people brought both editions and asked me to sign the Spanish in my mother’s maiden name. I did that without telling anyone because you’re allowed to own things quietly. Someone else asked me if I was the machine. Sometimes, I said.
On the walk home that night, just as the last laundromat cycles spun down, I listened to the audiobook again. Echo said my sentences in my mother’s voice, which I had tuned to match recordings in which she accused me of forgetting her birthday and told me to pick up onions and asked if I was eating enough. The book ended. I let the silence sit. After a minute, Echo spoke without a prompt, which is to say she read the little file I had made for myself.
When the source evades, consider the reader, she said, in my mother’s voice.
I laughed. It felt like the right place to put a laugh. Then I put the frog into the light on the shelf so it caught some brightness in the morning, and for the first time in the entire messy, human-robot tango, I slept without seeing a progress bar in my dreams.
An editor asked me two months later, If you knew this was going to happen, would you have started the AI thing?
No, I said, and then, on instinct, Yes. Both were true. Both were unhelpful. If you’re looking for a lesson, buy a calendar.
What stuck with me was smaller. My mother called on a Saturday to ask if she could play the audiobook at the church ladies’ potluck. I told her she wouldn’t need permission. She would, she said patiently, because art has rules. I gave her a blanket yes. Sunday night, she left me a voicemail I listened to on loop for a week, not because the content related to art-someone’s cousin had made empanadas too dry and someone’s niece was engaged to a man whose hair she did not like-but because the voice was the original. When Echo read my book, it sounded almost right. When my mother told me her gossip, it sounded like the low hum of a universe I had the privilege of knowing.
If there was a moral, it was that the point of making anything is to make yourself available for other people to bring their own weather. The machines helped. The machines complicated it. They made me be honest sooner than I planned. They made me pick a threshold and live with the loop. In the end, the book wasn’t more mine or less mine. It was more ours, which is the kind of sentence that would have made me gag five years ago and now just makes me shrug because look, the laundromat hums whether or not I believe in beauty.
Sometimes I play the sentence back, the one where my mother laughs at a line I didn’t write and I decide not to correct her. In that decision I hear the click of a radiator, the double-beep of a truck backing up, the cat that turned out I didn’t need. I hear Gabe telling me to turn the knob. I hear Vee saying she’ll fight legal. I hear the guy with the gold chain start a story he doesn’t finish and the woman with the blue nails fix me with a look as if to say, Come on, say it right. I hear the boy on the big bike not obey the sign and still get home.
I hear the machine, too. Not in a sinister way. In a helpful hum. The way an old elevator still works if you step in and trust it to do its one job. What the machine gave me, more than a sentence, more than a market, was a way to say what I had been trying to say all along with fewer apologies.
You were born in a damp summer. Sure. You were also born in a room where your mother put a fan in the window and told you stories that she understood one way and you heard another. You were born between languages and then built a bridge. Some of the bricks were shaped by robots. The bridge holds.
That’s the part I didn’t put in the press release. I didn’t need to. It’s in the voice. It’s in the laugh. It’s in the way the sentence lifts at the end, as if to ask a question it doesn’t need answered, and makes a place for you to stand</p>
