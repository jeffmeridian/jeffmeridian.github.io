<p>Fault Line<br>
The Grand Canyon wasn't supposed to hum, but that night it did. A low, weird vibration threaded the air like a note only the bones picked up. I lay awake in the bunk, staring at the gray ceiling of our RV while the cabinets ticked, and felt it run through me.<br>
Do you hear that? Rachel whispered. Her breath touched my shoulder. We'd cracked the window for the desert air and gotten cold and dust for our trouble. The kind of cold that clung to the inside of the nose.<br>
It's probably a generator, I said, because the RV park had a few. People who traveled with air fryers didn't like the dark.<br>
Our generator died in Page, she said. This isn't a generator.<br>
She wasn't wrong. The sound didn't have edges. It didn't start and stop. It pressed. It felt like the time a subway rolled under my building and a spoon in the sink rattled to call itself important.<br>
I slid my legs out of the bunk. The ladder flexed under my feet. Below, the kettle was still sitting on the stove where we'd left it, dented enough to be a family heirloom. On the counter, the Grand Canyon park map lay unfolded-a scabbed yellow thing with the trails spidered in red. Rachel had taken a pen to it earlier, circling viewpoints and scribbling numbers. She liked lists. The pen rolled, slowly, to the stove edge and tapped the back burner as if embarrassed to be seen showing off.<br>
Okay, I said softly. That's new.<br>
The RV shivered. Something thunked on the roof-maybe the brittle pine cone that had been threatening to jump all evening. The cupboard doors clicked in a line like someone walking by flicking their knuckles against them. Rachel's head popped over the bunk edge, curls wild and eyes already considering contingencies. She slept like a cat but woke like a firefighter.<br>
It's an earthquake, she said.<br>
We're not in California, I said, then winced at myself. Geography wasn't a protective shield. I knew that. We were in Arizona, yes, but the earth had grudges everywhere.<br>
The shiver became a shove. The RV took a half step we hadn't authorized and the kettle skated to the floor, hit rubber matting, and went for a little trip. I grabbed the stove, then let go immediately when it felt like a bad idea to anchor myself to something bolted to metal. The light above the sink swung and its pull chain ticked like a metronome playing too fast.<br>
Shoes, Rachel said. She was already moving, flinging the curtain aside to drop into the narrow aisle. We did not have a safety plan. We had a pack of Oreos, three headlamps, and the kind of bravado that comes from two people who haven't actually been tested. And pants, she added, because I'd slept in boxers, and at least one of us knew that wandering out into a campground without them was an even worse plan than hugging the stove.<br>
I jammed my legs into yesterday's jeans while the floor went liquid. The RV had a stabilizer on the back end, a crank we'd turned that afternoon until the wobble quit. It did nothing now. We were a shoebox on a jam jar, rolling over a ripple.<br>
The door handle rattled like someone wanted in, then stuck. Rachel shouldered it, clipped her elbow, swore. The rumble swelled-hard underneath, then higher, like wind pushing an organ note. It worked on my spine until I wanted to crawl out of my skin and run without it.<br>
Hey. I touched the side of her mouth with my thumb, a reflex I'd learned when we'd started arguing a month ago and I'd wanted to remind myself we were friends first. We go together.<br>
She met my eyes and nodded once. It wasn't romantic. It was tactical. We were both from families that had used nods like currency.<br>
The door went when we both leaned into it. Outside, the dark was not quite. Campground lights etched the pines in slices, and the moon was out, smeared with thin cloud. The air held that dry mineral smell-rock left out in the sun too long and now deciding to breathe. The ground under the pine needles didn't roll, exactly. More like someone tugged it in little handfuls.<br>
We weren't the only ones up. Down the loop, a couple in matching fleece stood with their phones raised, the blue rectangles bright on their faces as if they could record the earth into behaving. A kid's voice drifted from somewhere, high and tremulous, asking for his mom. Farther off, the rim, which we couldn't see from here but could sense in the brainstem the way the ocean is sensed on a foggy day, was a black bar against a lighter black. It felt like a mouth closed for a beat.<br>
Car, Rachel said.<br>
We didn't have one. We had Prospector, our RV, named by the previous owner on account of the scrape of its engine and the gold-painted pinstripes he'd added in an optimistic year. It had been ours for two months because Rachel had said we should go see something big before we made a decision about staying or stepping. The RV had been her compromise. A house on wheels, she'd said. Or at least a hallway on wheels.<br>
Out, I said, nodding at the road, which was only a few steps away. If the rig toppled, I didn't want to be underneath it. We stepped down to the asphalt, our bare feet slapping because we hadn't put on shoes after all. The pavement was more honest than the rubber mat inside. It transmitted everything. Not up and down. Side to side, in shivers, as if a very heavy animal had decided to walk past on a ridge we couldn't see.<br>
Rachel grabbed my hand and by reflex I squeezed. It was unromantic because my palm was sweaty and her knuckles dug into mine like a clamp. But it was also an admission that I liked finding her even in the dark. We had done this for movies, funerals, crowded buses. Not just because of love. Because of gravity.<br>
The rumble came with a crack. Dry, clean, a noise not from anything breaking we could touch but from something the size of a building exhaling wrong. The pines answered with a hiss. Dust whispered. A small shower of pebbles hit my ankle and I didn't think about where from.<br>
Get away from the trees, someone called. A man in a ranger hat-real one, flat with a brim wide enough to hide behind-jogged down the loop road with a flashlight. His face looked like it had been carved out of a smaller face. Too small for the concern it had to hold. He swept his light along the ground, probably looking for downed lines or fire. He waved an arm at us, then away, then back again when the road itself pitched.<br>
Another shove. The RV's ladder shrieked and something on the roof skittered the length with a suggestion of escape. We moved. Not far. It turned out you didn't have to be near the edge of the world to feel like you were about to fall off something.<br>
We weren't near the edge. The South Rim was a quarter mile and a stand of trees away. But in the mind, distance collapses. The canyon lurked. It was a hole so large the planet wept a little trying to keep it quiet.<br>
Fault line, Rachel said into my shoulder, and the words didn't belong to geology. They were a diagnosis and a confession. She might as well have said us.<br>
The main shove quit as if someone had been pulling a tablecloth and got tired. The smaller vibrations lingered. We stood in the middle of the road with other shaped shadows doing the same and listened to our breath. It sounded like an engine trying to start up on a cold morning-too fast and too loud and holding smoke.<br>
Are you okay? I said.<br>
Fine, she said, on a short exhale. Not annoyed. Compressed. You?<br>
Yeah. I wasn't. I wanted to make a joke about sleeping through worse in college in a house with mice, but my mouth didn't care. We were both in T-shirts and I could feel the damp of my fear in the cotton at my chest. The air didn't help. It made everything crisp.<br>
The ranger with the flashlight shouted for people to move to the restrooms because they had cinderblock walls and roofs that would not, probably, turn to knives. We followed the stream of bodies like we were getting into a ship. It was a single-story building painted the color of wet oatmeal. It would do.<br>
Inside, a woman with a baby stood in a stall with the door open, tears on her face. A teenager in a hoodie leaned against the sink, laughing uncontrollably, her laughter hitting every note in a weird scale. The ranger propped the door with a treetrunk he must have grabbed as he ran, or maybe that had been decor once and now it was a doorstop. People said things that weren't useful because it helped to have sound. An older guy in a too-clean fishing hat told everyone, twice, that the last time he was here it had been calm. I wanted to pat him.<br>
We stood in the corner by the urinals, the smell of what the desert did to human waste an oddly grounding force. Rachel took my hand again and slid her thumb over the knuckle as if polishing a coin.<br>
We should have brought the go bag, I said, because we had planned for tornadoes and breakups, not this.<br>
You mean the bin of batteries and granola bars? Her mouth flicked. We did bring it. It's under the dinette.<br>
I pictured Prospector, rocking on his axle, our tote of preparedness wedged by gravity into a corner, the granola bars aligning themselves with the container's molded curves. When it stopped, I'd think it funny. Now it felt like a punchline someone had stolen.<br>
For five minutes or fifty, we shared the tiny factory of air. The baby stopped crying and the teenager's laughter thinned to hiccups. The ranger kept stepping outside to look at sky and ground as if he could tell the difference between the two by squinting. Rachel kept moving her thumb back and forth over my skin. It wasn't a comfort so much as a reminder there was skin. We existed, no matter what the earth had to say about it.<br>
When the last of the vibrations lost nerve and the floor returned to being an invention of concrete, everyone spilled back out. We came like a school after a drill, tentative, pleased at having done something as a group. You could see the crowd relax into their stories even before the stories existed.<br>
We went to look at the RV because that's what you did when any part of your house might have become any part of the ground. Prospector had shifted a foot to the right. The chocks we'd wedged under the wheels had become decoration. A cupboard had popped open and vomited our plates onto the bench seat. A fork stood upright on the carpet like it was auditioning for a magic trick.<br>
Okay, I said. We still have a house.<br>
We have a hallway still pretending to be a house, Rachel said, and laughed, this time in a way that allowed itself out as air rather than panic.<br>
Our neighbors-retired teachers from Wisconsin we'd befriended in a line for showers by making faces at a squirrel-came over to see if we needed anything. Connie wore a robe with penguins, which felt like an act of defiance against the ecosystem.<br>
You two okay? she said, eyes tracking our bare feet. You forgot shoes.<br>
We were in a hurry, I said. My vanity will recover.<br>
Aftershock, her husband, Stewart, said, like a weather report he'd earned. They come in threes.<br>
That's gremlins, I said.<br>
Rachel elbowed me.<br>
We checked for leaks, fires, pets we didn't have. The night had gone back to being full of all the regular noises that had seemed quaint an hour ago, coyotes complaining about something they couldn't fix, wind pushing through trunks, the distant sound of someone closing a car door too gently. The canyon didn't hum anymore. It breathed.<br>
We tried to sleep. The earth has a talent for reminding you you're furniture and the housekeeping staff is unreliable. I listened to the soft groans of the RV frame and watched the window until dawn unstiffened it. At some point, I slept hard enough to dream of plates hopping in a kitchen lined with felt to cut down on noise. When I woke up, the map had slid off the table onto the floor and the pen, that idiot, had found its way into my shoe.<br>
It was the coffee that made the next hours real. Standing in line at the park store, the faces around me arranged themselves into versions of themselves-grim, bright, bored, romantic. We became a collection of characteristics: the woman who made jokes too loud, the guy who looked very concerned with his phone, the couple who didn't talk. Rachel and I were the pair who looked like they'd spent a month negotiating a treaty and accidentally written a grocery list.<br>
On the bulletin board, a paper said the earthquake had registered something interesting enough to put on local news if the internet hadn't felt like punishment. Minor rockfalls. Some trail closures. Monitoring ongoing. Be patient. Don't go near the edge. Don't be clever.<br>
We had a plan for the day, which was to hike part of Bright Angel and fail at the first switchback because we were out of shape, then eat sandwiches with too much mustard at Mather Point while I pretended the view hurt my eyes. Instead, we watched a ranger staple a new notice over an old one and tell a group of post-college kids in Lululemon that the trail was closed until they confirmed stability. The kids nodded earnestly as if they could confirm stability via enthusiasm.<br>
A man in a red vest who turned out to be a volunteer asked for water jugs. The store had put a sign out: donations for the far viewpoints where water had gone offline. The quake had cracked a pipe at Yaki Point. They needed to set up stations and bring jugs for the older folks who hadn't left before sunrise. The road was closed to cars. Bikes were fine. Feet were fine. He was making a list of people stupid enough to be helpful.<br>
I'll go, Rachel said, before the man had finished asking, her hand already on the counter with that tips-in-a-jar energy. She had the gift of moving toward trouble as if it was a party she wasn't invited to. It suited her. She was an emergency room nurse before the ER told her it couldn't pay for the person she turned into there. Now she traveled around the country doing stints for hospitals where the count of rooms and the count of nurses stubbornly disagreed. She was the sort of person who had a headlamp in her purse and treated that as normal. We had met in a waiting room when my friend had broken his wrist and I had been the only person who thought to bring a book.<br>
I'll go with you, I said, because the road was closed and we were on foot and this was the sort of thing couples in forgiveness arcs did.<br>
She looked at me. Something moved across her face like a shadow of a bird you don't track because you don't want to know if it's hunting. You don't have to, she said. You hate crowds.<br>
I don't hate crowds, I said. I hate people in large numbers.<br>
She made a sound that conceded the point and didn't. They said it's two miles. We carry a couple of jugs, drop them, come back.<br>
She didn't say and decide again if we are a thing after the trip. She didn't say choose me, choose you. We had said those things in different languages already. We'd been on this trip to test whether life was better with both of us or we were better apart. We had used more polite words, nicer than truth. See something big and get clear, she'd said, drawing a circle around the canyon on the map. But without the big meaning, I'd said. Enough of those at work.<br>
Okay, and there it was. The other thing. I was a planner. It wasn't a career title. It was a habit. I liked projects with checklists and timestamps. At work, that meant operations for a company that sold biodegradable trash bags to people with a very specific kind of anxiety. At home, it meant making dinner for four friends and a spreadsheet for who brought what. It looked like competence until it looked like fear.<br>
Two jugs each, the volunteer said. We have hand trucks but they're at the lot. We'll bring them up as soon as we can get through. He gave us each a smile like a permission slip and wrote our names down because writing things down meant they existed.<br>
We started down the paved path toward Yaki with a set of mismatched plastic containers between us, twenty gallons total, one mesmerizing slosh. It made a little drumbeat against the sides as we walked. Other people passed us with dogs pulling. A drone buzzed somewhere like a fly that had paid too much for itself.<br>
You're going to go to Seattle, I said, an announcement aimed at the horizon. Her last contract had been in Tempe. She'd done two months. They'd begged her to stay. She had said yes for four days and then no because she was tired of the men on the trauma team reminding her of what she already knew. When she'd gotten the offer in Seattle it had lit her up in a way the desert hadn't. I had told her I liked the desert. You could hear yourself think there. She had said it was too much thinking. We had both been right and it hadn't helped.<br>
I got the email, she said. They want me in three weeks.<br>
The jugs banged my shins. The road raised and lowered under us in that subtle way of park roads throughout the country-just enough uphill to wonder why you thought you were fit. The trees on our left broke and the canyon opened. It did not hum. It did not roar. It simply existed, and anything we said in the face of it sounded like commentary on God's handwriting.<br>
I didn't say don't go, and she didn't say stay or come. We had both burned those words down already. I had said I have my job and my mother is an hour away, which meant I was scared of being farther. She had said I can't stop traveling because when I stop I hear everything, and the sounds aren't kind. We were both telling the truth in the way people do when the truth is smaller than what they wish.<br>
A mile in, we hit a cluster of people half on the road and half off it. Two bikers had laid their rides down and a woman in a sunhat sat on the curb cradling her arm, the shape under the sleeve wrong. A kid with grass-stained knees held a dog that didn't understand why everyone had stopped moving. The dog licked the kid's fingers as if they were made of salt.<br>
I'm a nurse, Rachel said, moving toward the woman with the arm. She said it with the authority of a soldier calling rank. The crowd made space.<br>
You do this, I said, and meant it. Even if nobody needed me, I could carry water and hold a dog.<br>
She knelt, said hello in a voice that made room, touched the elbow gently, and looked at the woman's face and not the bent arm. I watched the shapes her hands made-firm, efficient, and careful where it counted. It had been the same when she worked on me that winter I had tried to build a bookshelf with tools I'd borrowed and dignity I didn't have. She had laughed that time, but not in a way that pinched. Now she asked the woman's name and what day it was and what had happened, and the woman breathed out a story of staying out too long at the canyon edge to watch the light shift and then losing balance when another aftershock shrugged the world. A small fall, an unlucky angle.<br>
You called it, I said to her later, when we were walking again, our jugs emptied at the viewpoint onto a table that had become an altar to hydration. We had strapped the woman's arm with a magazine and a scarf and sent her toward the shuttle with a man who had a trustworthy neck. The boy with the dog had given me a look like gratitude was a muscle you had to break in to use.<br>
Called what?<br>
The aftershock. Gremlins. You know when things will trip you, even when the floor is flat.<br>
That's what I do, she said. I see what will trip people.<br>
And then you stay anyway.<br>
If no one stays, they're alone when they fall. She kept walking. I watched the back of her head because I'd always liked it-the way her hair spiraled at the crown, the small scar by her ear from when she'd tried to shave her head at nineteen. The jug handles hurt my fingers. The pain had a nice innocence. It didn't pretend to be anything else. Carry weight, feel ache.<br>
We reached the Yaki turnoff where a ranger was standing with his arms crossed into an X that could have been friendly or final. Behind him, beyond the orange netting and the plastic barrier that said DO NOT, the road had a new seam. It wasn't dramatic. No picture of a yawn with two halves misaligned would go viral. It was a long thin crack that wandered like a drunk. At the far edge of the crack, the asphalt had dropped an inch. It was an undulant line the length of two buses. The earth had set a rule. Everyone else explained it, and then obeyed.<br>
We're not letting anyone out there, the ranger said. His face was a softer version of the one last night-a younger ranger, less carved. He held a clipboard he had not earned yet.<br>
We only want to get the water to the older folks, Rachel said, that tone again. The voice she used for other people's emergencies. She was already looking past him at the small gathering of retirees in sunhats waving like they were on the deck of a ship and the dock had pulled away.<br>
We'll get it to them, the ranger said, and meant it like a promise. He took one jug from me and one from her, staggered under their weight, and then accepted that he had to ask for help. If you file along the edge and step over one at a time-no. Sorry. I can't. If there's an aftershock-<br>
We can do it quick, Rachel said.<br>
He shook his head. I watched the crack. It had a shape the brain didn't like. Not an open mouth, not teeth. Just a line that denied things we liked to pretend were given. I could have stepped over it. People step over a lot worse for less.<br>
Rachel turned to me, the question already open in her eyes. This was the point our fight had circled. We had been moving toward it for weeks. Do we break the rule, make our own because it's smarter, get the result. Do we walk around and wait and live with what the wait costs.<br>
I want to go, she said.<br>
I don't.<br>
We stood there with jugs in our hands like a metaphor from a first-year writing workshop and felt the weight of who we were slide around in our palms. The ranger watched us, and then had the humanity to remove his gaze like a curtain pulled aside. People often forget that privacy is sometimes a gift and not a wall.<br>
We can split up, Rachel said. You can go back. I can- She didn't finish. She didn't say it in the tone of the many people who had told her she could or couldn't or should or shouldn't. She said it like it was just the shape of her. A person who crossed lines if somebody needed something.<br>
If I said yes, she would go. She would cross and the ground would probably hold because the earth didn't tend to make points via the convenient death of one woman with a symmetrical face and a large capacity for carrying water. If I said no, she would sometimes do it anyway, because she was a person and not a dog. If I said yes and it held, we would deliver the jugs and she would feel the rush of doing the thing again, and next time the crack would be wider and the cliff closer. If I said no and didn't go with her, we would have a canyon between us that had nothing to do with granite.<br>
I can't ask you not to be you, I said. It came out small and honest as a button. But I can choose me. I don't want to cross.<br>
She looked at the crack again. The tilt of her head softened. I watched her calculate risk like someone counting to an unfamiliar number. Then she looked at the retirees in their sunhats and at the ranger's clipboard. She looked at me. It was the last look of a particular story.<br>
I won't cross, she said. I'll go talk to them. Make sure they sit. Tell stories.<br>
Pain moved through me and settled, different than dread. It felt like putting a favorite mug in a box at a friend's house because it wouldn't survive your kitchen. I took the jug from her and handed it to the ranger. You take them, I said. You're the rule. Be useful.<br>
He nodded, glad to be told, and gathered two more volunteers with arms like fence posts. They stepped to the very edge of obedience, breathed in, waited to be certain the air wouldn't collapse, and then stepped over. The retirees clapped. It sounded like rain on a tarp.<br>
Rachel went to the edge of the barrier and called to a woman in a cardigan who had the air of someone who should have been drinking iced tea instead of standing in vacation danger. She asked her about family. She told her we had water coming and that she looked like an aunt Rachel loved. She lied about something small to make a stranger feel safer. It was a sweet lie. I held the rolled tongue of the DO NOT barrier and didn't mind its texture.<br>
We walked back slow. The path sloped down and the jugs were empty and my hands sang anyway. A guy passing us whistled and I wanted to punch him for being a person. Then I wanted to shake his hand because he was proof we weren't alone. The canyon sat at our left like an elder that had forgotten our names and loved us anyway.<br>
Back at the store, we returned the jugs and wrote our names on the volunteer sheet again for afternoon shifts because we were both the sort of people who did that despite arguments. We sat on a bench with our knees touching but not leaning. People came and went with their stories pinned to them as if the stories were badges: We didn't feel a thing; I held my kid and cried; I took video; I didn't have service and had to talk to my own brain; The road cracked and it made a sound like a zipper. I listened and unhooked my jaw and breathed.<br>
At noon the sky turned the color of metal and the wind got that taste of rain dragged across rock. We ducked into Prospector and made sandwiches with the last of the good bread and the first of the old cheese. The knife skipped around the tomatoes and left the counter looking like a crime scene if the victim had been a salad. Rachel licked mustard off her thumb and said, I can't watch that documentary with you anymore. The one with the couple who stayed together because of the dog.<br>
The dog was very persuasive, I said.<br>
She wiped a spot of sauce off the map without looking and left a clean circle that felt like a void. Can we do the afternoon shift? she asked.<br>
We can, I said. Then after, we should look at flights. I said we and meant we in the way of divide. Flights out of Flagstaff for her to Seattle. Flights for me. Or drives for me. I could take Prospector home and sell him to someone with dreams of not deciding anything soon. I was good at fostering misplaced dreams.<br>
You'll come visit? she said. It wasn't a plea. It was logistics.<br>
I will, I said, because it felt like a promise we'd actually keep. Not because we'd find the old us, but because parts of us deserved to know they mattered when it didn't. I would walk with her to a coffee shop in a city that had to invent light in winter, and she would sit on my old couch and watch me try to grow herbs in bad dirt, and we would be something else true.<br>
When the rain came, it came as dots fat enough to make a point. The dust took it and turned it into the smell of first grade-clay and radish seeds and someone else's sweater. We walked out into it without jackets because we were tired of being sensible. The storm passed in a diagonal and left the pines shining at the edges. We saw Connie from Wisconsin in her penguin robe and waved. She waved back with both hands, too cheerful for the weather, too cheerful for age. It is a defiance to stay cheerful.<br>
The afternoon shift was easier. The road had chosen its shape and held it. The aftershocks quit like a car finally convinced by a cold. The retirees made it back with the help of two young men with tattoos of trees on their shins, which felt like a message that didn't need an interpretation. The ranger with the new face had dirt on his knee where he'd fallen and he wore it like a credential.<br>
On the way back to Prospector, we cut through a stand of juniper and came upon a place where the ground had cracked in a thin chevron in the dirt. It was a small version of the road seam, a practice line. I stepped over, then back, because I could. Rachel stepped over and didn't step back. She looked at me and we both understood the metaphor was sick of us.<br>
This was always the shape, she said.<br>
I know.<br>
I love you, she said. She said it like fact. We had never had a problem with that line. It had never been the thing that moved. It persisted like the red stripe in rock telling a different story than the one on top.<br>
I love you, I said. The wind took nothing that mattered.<br>
We walked back to the RV with our shoulders almost touching, the space between us a strange, new thing-it wasn't absence; it wasn't yet history. It was room for everything that would come and everything that wouldn't. We didn't hurry. evening was doing that long desert thing where it took forever to arrive and then fell all at once.<br>
Rachel packed her bag that night. Just the essentials: scrubs, a pair of shoes still wet from the rain, the book about a woman walking a very long distance alone. She left the mug we'd bought in Flagstaff because it had chipped already and she believed in good cups. I watched her move through the tiny space we had called a home like someone walking the line between two theaters: stage left, stage right, exit upstage through forest. We talked about nothing. Where to leave the key to the lockbox. Whether Prospector's toilet would punish me if we didn't buy the good chemicals. When to call her mother, who would require a story that made this break seem like an intellectual exercise and not the end of the little circle we had drawn in the same bed for two years.<br>
I'll take the early shuttle to Flagstaff, she said. Flights are easier from there.<br>
I'll drive down after lunch, I said. It's-I'd like a morning. I wanted to sit in the empty RV and feel the shape of it without her moving in it. I wanted to be a person in a small tin room and listen to the canyon breathe.<br>
She nodded. It was a nice nod. The best of them.<br>
We slept like we had the night before the earth moved, backs to each other, one knee touching, ready to roll toward or away. In the morning, the canyon was the color of peach pits. Rachel put her bag on her shoulder and kissed me. It was not cinematic. It was efficient and kind. On the way out, she ran into Connie, who gave her a bag of caramels and a lecture on weather she would know by now if she'd been sleeping with the radio on. Rachel laughed and cried and set the candy on the table like an offering.<br>
After she left, I sat at the dinette with the cracked map and taped it where the fold had given up. The tape pulled wrong because the air was dry. I smoothed it with a thumb. You couldn't fix a fold with tape. You could fit the pieces back together and know where the line had been. That would have to do.<br>
On my walk that late morning, I stood at Mather Point and ate a sandwich with too much mustard. I watched a man propose and a woman say yes, and I might have hated them for a second if I hadn't loved the way his hands shook. A kid gave his dad a rock and told him it was the best rock, and the dad accepted it like a secret.<br>
The canyon didn't convey a lesson. It wasn't here for that. It was a hole made by persistence and weather, carved in small rude acts until it became what it was. The earth flexed and we made our little decisions. We crossed lines or we stood.<br>
When my phone found a bar, I texted Rachel a picture of the crack in the dirt with my shoe next to it for scale, and typed: We were never going to be a bridge.<br>
She wrote back a minute later, a photo of her on the shuttle, rain in the window, her face crabbed by reflection and still beautiful because it was hers: No. But we were a good trail.<br>
After, I tracked the aftershocks in a corner of a USGS website that looked like it had been designed in 1998 and carefully maintained since. I read about faults and stresses and how energy sought release along the line of least resistance. I thought about the RV with the fork upright on the carpet. I put the fork back in the drawer and it rattled when a shuttle went by.<br>
Things hold. Things give. We find the line and call it a place to stand. Or we step across and call it a choice. Either way, the ground keeps being ground. It remembers, though. It keeps the seam. And sometimes, if you stand very still, put your hand against the bark of an old pine, and lean into the silence, you can almost hear the fault line hum. Not threatening. Just reminding. You're here. The line is here. It's not the end of anything. It's only where one thing ends and another starts, a thin bright seam that, with enough time, becomes a canyon, and with even more time, maybe flattens out until you can't see it. Unless you know where to look.</p>
