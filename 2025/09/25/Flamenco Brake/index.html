<p>Flamenco Brake: Spain Without the 'S' and Occasionally the 'ABS'<br>
The hiss sounded like the ocean trying to keep a secret and failing. Is that the Atlantic? Lola whispered, a hand over her heart, eyes gone wide with the kind of awe usually reserved for auroras and men in tight pants doing flamenco footwork. Teo sniffed. It's the canister.<br>
Pause. Flash. Boom.<br>
This is how our spiritual road trip began: with a small propane tantrum in Cádiz and the realization that heaven speaks in burps and scorch marks.<br>
Cut, Lola told the GoPro on the dashboard, as if the camera were an unruly extra. Reset. We'll say it was a sunrise.<br>
Is the sunrise supposed to smell like singed eyebrow? Teo asked, patting his face. Be honest. I look distinguished. Like a startled professor.<br>
Like a startled yak, Lola said. But sexy.<br>
Enter: Panic, the chihuahua, who had the emotional maturity of a seasoned flight attendant and the scream of a kettle. He took one look at the curling smoke ribbon and launched into Morse code. Panic enjoyed two things: being right and being wrong loudly.<br>
Also starring: Carmen VanDiego, their van, a gleaming white rectangle with aloof mirrors and a roof rack that had big I carry dreams and surfboards energy. She had been a refrigerated delivery truck in a past life, then a food truck, then a yoga studio in a gig economy's fever dream, until finally she found herself purchased by Lola and Teo with a combination of savings, sponsorships, and a crowdfunding campaign called Fund Our Soul Quest Or We'll Become Influencers Anyway.<br>
They were vanfluencers. Which is to say, they were the plague and the cure: oversharing their empathy in square frames, bargaining with the algorithm, slicing sunsets into reels. They called their channel Soul Propulsion. They said, We're on a journey to find our best selves, as if their best selves had been misfiled under S for Spain, and the Iberian Peninsula was a lost and found with tapas.<br>
Welcome, Soulmates, Lola intoned as the smoke dissipated, voice smooth as a podcast about bread. We begin our odyssey in ancient Cádiz, a city older than your therapist. This is the hiss of destiny. This is the sizzle of-<br>
-the warning label you didn't read, Teo said, holding up a singed instruction manual, the kind that whispered, You should have been a librarian. Teo wore the expression of a man who believed in science except when he needed something to be magic. He was the kind of person who said phrases like, If you think about it, electricity is basically polite lightning, and then got shocked by toasters.<br>
The hiss was indeed the canister: their propane, praying for better owners. They turned it off. They high-fived. Panic judged them. The van hummed with a thousand unsaid disclaimers. The sky pretended it had always smelled like nothing.<br>
They posted. It got views. Comments rolled in from people named EarthDaughter and VanBro69, saying things like, Loving the authenticity, and, What's your rig setup, kings and queens? They had arrived. They were on a road trip to documentary immortality. Spain, they had decided, was basically a masterclass. The universe? A professor in a linen suit, gesturing toward the board where it had chalked: Pay Attention To The Signs.<br>
And dear reader, if a dashboard light winks, it's not flirting.<br>
Valencia came in, under a hot-breathed sky that smelled like oranges considering life choices. They parked along what used to be a river and had rebranded as a park with better marketing. Riverbeds are just rivers with commitment issues, Teo said to camera, and several meteorologists sneezed.<br>
The rain arrived like an email you don't open because you know it ends with restructuring. It committed to them. It committed so hard that within minutes the park began massaging them into motion. A flash flood scooped them up like a bored god collecting erasers.<br>
This is fine, Lola shouted over the drumroll on the roof. This is the universe washing us of old patterns.<br>
This is the universe putting us in the rinse cycle, Teo corrected, Shakiraing his shoulders as he tried to steer. I didn't consent to tumble dry.<br>
Panic surfed the dinette bench with the calm of a tiny messiah. The flood decided they would now take a tour of three postcodes east. Carmen VanDiego, loyal but skeptical, adjusted. They found asphalt again. They found a trucker flipping a coin that looked like it had seen things. They found themselves laughing. Because this, they said into their cameras, was the point: surrender. Also, we do not have adequate flood insurance.<br>
We learned quickly that every region would offer catastrophic feedback like a tapas menu of calamity. The Andalusian mountains were a runway for their illusions. I'll just level the RV, Teo declared on a road that had dismissed the concept of level in 1745. With what?<br>
My body, apparently, Lola said, hanging off the side like a decorative saint.<br>
Do we have chocks?<br>
Do we have God?<br>
Ligatures snapped somewhere above them where the winds had discussions with the clouds. The mountains shrugged. The van canted. Panic reinvented the octave. Dear reader: there is no moral fiber in a parking brake. Gravity is unbothered by your affirmations.<br>
In La Mancha, a tire blew with the operatic confidence of a tenor hitting a high C. They limped into a service area called Don Quixote's Stop and Shop. The mechanic had a mustache that could swat flies into character arcs. That tire was a suggestion, not a commitment, he said, then proceeded to bench-press Carmen's front end with a jack and a sigh. Lola filmed his forearms in the reflective sheen of becoming the villain.<br>
People need this, she whispered. It's about resilience.<br>
It's about torque, Teo said, counting in Spanish and fluency. Uno, dos, the rest.<br>
In Barcelona, on a hillside that smelled like pine and aspiration, they discovered that spontaneous combustion is less spontaneous if you neglect maintenance schedules. A small, earnest smoke curled out of the engine bay as they admired a view that influencers use as stock therapy. It's pine-scented ambience, Teo said with a grin that begged the gods not to notice him. They noticed. The pine smoked back.<br>
They emptied a fire extinguisher with the enthusiasm of people spraying champagne on a podium for the fifth place. The foam was celebratory. The foam was a new kind of regret. So the light that looks like a genie lamp, Lola mused, is...?<br>
Oil pressure, Teo sighed. It's not a wish granter. It's a silent scream.<br>
Madrid, in the exhaust-choked intimacy of urban patience, gifted them a semi-truck that honked existential truths. It came up behind them on the ring road and leaned on its horn like a philosopher leaning on his student loan debt. What's he saying? Lola asked, white-knuckle steering in a lane that may have been theoretical.<br>
He's saying, 'I am heavier than your dreams,' Teo answered, and changed lanes into a lane that was empirically an exit.<br>
Seville was a chase scene. More precisely: Seville was a slow-motion ballet where their van was stolen by a man wearing a shirt that said YOLO, whom they chased down the street with Lola wielding a selfie stick like a bo staff. It turns out, when you leave your keys in the ignition in a city designed by poets, a thief will compose a sonnet about your mistake and drive away with the last couplet.<br>
They recovered Carmen three streets over because the thief realized the steering made a noise that could be used to summon whales. Also, Panic bit him in the sock. This is a metaphor, Lola panted.<br>
For what?<br>
For forgiveness.<br>
Forgiveness is a steering column that costs 482 euros, Teo said, writing in the ledger of their failure.<br>
The Pyrenees arrived in footnotes and switchbacks. They climbed into altitude and found themselves Flamenco braking: stamp, stamp, pray. It's like dancing, Lola said, eyes luminescent with delirium. It's like you're sandals and the mountain is your mother.<br>
It's like the pads are writing their memoir, Teo said. The brakes faded like a celebrity in a trilogy. Panic took up yoga. They descended with deliberate, breath-holding grace, stopping every kilometer to let the aroma of eau de panic dissipate from the cabin.<br>
In the Picos de Europa, they discovered minimalism. We have two gears left, Lola announced, her voice the exact pitch of a kettle and a violinist agreeing to duel. Scream and Coast.<br>
I choose Coast, Teo said, and they did, sliding along with the nobility of a greased penguin. Carmen was learning new prayers. The mountains were patient. Panic kept a small diary labeled My Truth.<br>
Galicia tried to be gentle. A near miss-but the head-on kind that still managed to head-on their sense of destiny. They were in a fog as thick as nostalgia. Out of that haze came a vehicle with the confidence of a recruiter and the generosity of a tax audit. There was a breath where physics took a meeting with inevitability. They passed each other with a span of air measured in regret. Lola and Teo sat there afterward, listening to how loud a heart can get in a small room.<br>
Signs, Lola said faintly. We need to read signs.<br>
You mean the ones that say Stop? Teo swallowed. Not just the ones in my horoscope?<br>
Asturias, not to be outdone, removed a cliff beneath their parking brake. They had parked. They had made tea. Gravity had other plans and like all good antagonists, it did not explain itself. Carmen shifted a centimeter, then two, then enough that Lola found herself in a standing sprint with a kettle, and Teo somehow was both inside and outside the van, trying to wedge a rock under a tire with a conviction usually reserved for revolutionary movements. Panic took on the shape of pure geometry and shouted the digits of pi.<br>
They survived because the rock believed in them. Or because friction is a convert if you preach hard enough. They went to a bar where a grandmother served cider with a scowl that contained three centuries of common sense. Parking brake is a suggestion, she told them, wiping a glass with a cloth that knew secrets. Gravity doesn't read your blog.<br>
In Catalonia, a test-drive ended in a home visit-through the wall. They had taken Carmen in for steering adjustments, exciting new noises included free. The mechanic tossed them the keys with the confidence of a man who has eaten lunch. Teo circled the parking lot. Carmen took umbrage at a turn. The wall, a thin layer of stucco entirely unprepared to meet someone from Madrid, met them with the shattering softness of a wet cookie.<br>
I always wanted an open-plan garage, the mechanic said, coughing dust. I suppose this is your contribution to my feng shui.<br>
We'll pay, Lola said sincerely, then did a calculation in her soul that broke several abacuses.<br>
In Extremadura, they were T-boned by their faith in rural tranquility. Picture a dusty road, a sun like a benevolent dictator, a local farmer in a tractor with a schedule. They rolled through an intersection that had long since retired from giving warnings. The tractor kissed them with industrial tenderness. Carmen spun. Panic saw his ancestors.<br>
No serious injuries, just a new appreciation for stop signs and miracles. The farmer brought them tomatoes and apologies. My father always said the city is dangerous, he shrugged, but who am I, a poet, to talk. They ate tomatoes in the shade of a catastrophe, thinking about how soft the world is and how hard we insist on making it.<br>
Zaragoza lit the fuel pump flambé. It sputtered when they pulled into a service area. It's fine, Teo said, the way exhausted people say Fine like a rainbow says Beige. He tapped it one too many times and suddenly the pump introduced oxygen to a party it shouldn't have been invited to. With a whomp, a blue tongue licked the air.<br>
This is new, Lola breathed.<br>
This is bad, said every manual they'd ignored, collectively. They smothered it with a wool blanket and a fever dream. They made a note in their guidebook a Google Doc with delusions: If it sizzles, blow. If it glows, go.<br>
Granada threw in a surprise fuel-line fire because apparently Spanish cities were hosting a tapas crawl for combustion. On the bright side, we found the dashboard light's purpose, Teo said, wedging himself under Carmen while Lola practiced the ancient art of calling emergency numbers in a second language with the grace of a raccoon ordering sushi. Afterward, they stood by the Alhambra, rats of the sun, marveling at Moorish ornament, thinking about the inlaid patterns of drama they were weaving into their lives.<br>
Murcia debuted the silent-robbing ballet. They were sleeping, mouths open to dreams that involved fewer receipts, when a whisper-crew removed every portable thing not already welded to their guilt. They woke up to an absence of cameras, a missing portable solar panel, and the lingering tap dance of nimble thieves. Panic finally earn his name by screaming at a moth. Their audience, who had come for sunsets and stayed for punches in the gut, wrote comments like, This is a sign, and, You manifested challenge! Lola threw her phone into a pillow. I manifested boundaries, she hissed.<br>
Bilbao's low underpass met their roof with the tenderness of a guillotine. You don't realize how in love you are with your roof vents until you hear them being peeled back like the lid on a yogurt. They sat under the underpass, collecting their dignity in a Tupperware. A local man in a beret informed them, in the small-schoolteacher tone that Basques are famous for, Altura maxima does not mean, 'Try your luck.' It means height is a finite resource.<br>
Great cities are honest, Teo said, adding a tarp to his list of necessary illusions.<br>
Tarifa became a sand-trap baptism. The wind there is a theology. It picks people up and puts them down two centimeters to the left and calls it character development. They drove onto a beach with joyous hubris, which is the only kind. They sank up to their axles in sand so fine it played the piano. Panic took one step onto the beach and was blown into Portugal.<br>
A convoy of kitesurfers pulled them free, laughing the laughter of men who crave friction. Lola filmed the rescue, hair horizontal. Teo narrated with granules in his teeth. We have been humbled, he said, spitting out a dune, by sand, which is just tiny rocks that didn't get enough hugs.<br>
Inside the van, life continued in its own war. The black tank became a noir antagonist. It developed a voice. You think you can ignore me? it whispered every time they flushed. You think actions don't have consequences?<br>
Who are you talking to? Lola would ask from the counter, where she was peeling cheese into concepts.<br>
The tank, Teo would reply. It's lonely. It wants to be seen.<br>
Don't we all, Lola said, and then the fridge committed a cheese-based war crime. Something dairy and ambitious bloomed back there, an ecosystem that filed for legal recognition. They opened the door and were punched in the face by a scent that registered as a fully realized democracy. Panic fainted. They named the smell Blue Monday and moved on with their lives, as all heroes must.<br>
Ants, mice, and wasps unionized and elected a foreman named Pepito, who, as the story goes, had a tiny helmet and a whistle and a plan. They formed a picket line across the sink and demanded better conditions, translation: crumbs. Pepito negotiated a treaty whereby the wasps could occupy the ceiling vents and the mice would audition for Pixar in the pantry. Lola found herself making inspirational speeches to the ants. You are so small and so determined, she told them. You are micro-influencers.<br>
You have lost control of the narrative, Teo said, as a wasp did a flyby buzz that spelt PRIVACY in Morse code. He ordered screens. The screens went on strike.<br>
The wind tried to roll them. Appliances tried to ghost them. Their propane line became a long-distance relationship with danger, full of mixed signals and unplanned meet-cutes. A dashboard light blinked for days, making eye contact at dawn and dusk like a suitor with a secret. Dear reader, Lola said into the camera whisper, if a dashboard light winks, it's not flirting. It's filing for divorce.<br>
Through it all, they kept posting. The internet loves a train wreck. Especially one with a drone shot. They veered increasingly into mockumentary: deadpan cutaways in front of ancient Roman bridges where Teo would say, The arch is a metaphor for my hopes. Load-bearing and flexible, and then an unseen pigeon would relieve itself on his shoulder and he would add, Also, subject to gravity and destiny's progressive tax.<br>
And then Aragón. The finale you could feel even if you didn't know finales. A calm riverside campsite, the kind with watercolor light and children who have never been sticky. The river was polite, the trees wearing leisure. We did it, Lola sighed, as if the universe had graduated and was free to travel. A safe place.<br>
Spain is not trying to kill us, Teo said, stretching his spine into a yes. Our optimism is.<br>
Put that on a T-shirt, Lola said, and meant it.<br>
They set up their chairs, their s'mores, their illusions. The sky put on a discount star show. Panic fell asleep with his tongue out like a party streamer. The van settled on her haunches, content.<br>
At three in the morning, the river changed its mind.<br>
They woke to water fingerpainting their ankles. The campsite was a half-minute away from Atlantis. Someone shouted in German in a way that made the water step back, but not far enough.<br>
Do we swim? Lola asked, hair already doing a Greek tragedy.<br>
We evolve, Teo said, grabbing the industrial-sized squeegee they had bought in a gas station because the algorithm told them squeegees were the new meditation bells. The squeegee became Excalibur. The water became an employee with a grievance. They fought.<br>
It was slapstick and sacrament. Teo, waist-deep, pushing water out with frantic dignity. Lola, perched on a chair on top of the picnic table, calling orders like a general in a war against damp. Panic surfed a cutting board like a saint on a tortilla. Carmen's electrical panel took on a thousand-yard stare. The river shrugged with the shoulders of a nation's worth of rainfall upstream.<br>
Here is your turning point: the cameras, perched on their shelves, were witnessing a viral moment. The kind that would extract sponsors from their burrows. The easy choice, the human-ego choice, said: film it. Make your suffering into content. Turn the flood into a thumbnail with a screaming face.<br>
Lola looked at the cameras, their little robot eyes unblinking. Teo looked at Lola, the human eye blinking too fast.<br>
Don't, Lola said.<br>
But-<br>
Don't. Help me. Please. She didn't raise her voice. She just switched languages mid-sentence: from the dialect of performance to the dialect of reality.<br>
Teo put the GoPro down. He picked up the squeegee. In that quiet decision, louder than any honking semi, every calamity twisted into a new shape: not content, consequence. Not signs, science. Not feedback from the cosmos, feedback from the pipes. They were in a flood. No symbolism needed. Just friends, love, and a heroic piece of sanitation equipment.<br>
They worked until dawn peeled a corner of the night and flapped it like a flag. The water retreated, disappointed but respectful. The campsite looked like the morning after a history. The Germans gave them coffee with the stern benevolence of classical music. A woman from Zaragoza handed them towels and a lecture. The lecture contained wisdom and a recipe for lentils.<br>
They laughed, choked, cried a snip, laughed again. It was the laugh of people who had misread every horoscope and finally bought a calendar. They spent the day in sun, drying sheet by sheet, memory by memory. Panic napped inside the wheel well, dreaming of rivers learning manners. Carmen, wounded, gave a brave little beep when Teo tested a light. It wasn't the light that had winked. It was another one, new to the chorus.<br>
They made a choice. They decided to go home.<br>
Not because they were beaten. Because sometimes the quest is a circle you draw so that you can step out of it. Because sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do is stop making metaphors and buy a torque wrench.<br>
They drove north and east, each kilometer a sigh. They stopped for the things they hadn't stopped for on the way down: a man making knives by hand; a church where the tourists whispered the way your mother whispered on the phone when she didn't want you to know your uncle had opinions; a café where the croissants were crisp enough to cut and soft enough to forgive. They filmed, but with gentleness, as if cameras were grandchildren and needed naps.<br>
At the border, the customs officer asked, Anything to declare? They looked at each other. Yes, Teo said. Humility. Several kilos.<br>
No fruit, Lola added. But we do have an illegal amount of candor.<br>
The officer waved them through with a smile that seemed to know that lives are lists we keep misplacing.<br>
At home, they parked Carmen VanDiego in the garage. The perfect, safe parking spot. The light was the kind of light that makes garages look like movie sets in which nothing bad happens. They turned the engine off. The silence seemed edible.<br>
We survived by weaponizing wit, friendship, and an industrial-sized squeegee, Lola summarized, because she wasn't entirely cured. They co-wrote a book. How Not To Die In A Van In Spain. Chapters included: The Hiss of Cádiz, Brake Me Up Before You Go-Go, Paella Under Pressure, Flambé Dreams and Propane Nightmares, Pepito: A Union Story, Gravity Doesn't Read Your Blog, 1000 and 1 Ways To Misinterpret a Dashboard Light, and the pièce de resistance: Atlantis, Or, How I Learned To Stop Filming And Love The Squeegee.<br>
They printed exactly eleven copies, because the algorithm had never heard of scarcity. Their friends read it and laughed so hard their honest scars ached. Their mothers read it and made them soup and phoned their therapists. Their commenters said, This is growth, and, When's the sequel, because human beings will always ask for season two.<br>
They reorganized their garage, which is to say they moved boxes from one place to a place that felt like progress. Panic adopted a chicken that wandered in and decided to identify as a cat. Pepito the ant foreman went missing in action, presumed retired to the potted basil. They slept in a bed that didn't threaten to roll.<br>
Two weeks later, a letter arrived. It had that official heft that makes you stand straighter. The envelope was stained with something that looked like sangria and smelled like destiny.<br>
Dear Carmen VanDiego, it read, in a font that had attended festivals. Congratulations. You have been accepted to run with the bulls.<br>
They looked at each other. There was a silence as long as a castanet.<br>
This is a joke, Teo said. Is this what spam looks like on paper?<br>
It's addressed to the van, Lola said, blinking. Who is writing to our van.<br>
Maybe the van applied on her own, Teo muttered. I mean, we anthropomorphize her all the time. Perhaps she anthropo-actualized.<br>
Spain does have paperwork, Lola said, remembering a man in Pamplona whose calves were earnest.<br>
They laughed. They framed the letter. They went to bed.<br>
In the morning, the garage was empty.<br>
The door was up, and there were tire marks like a signature. The neighbor swore they had heard a low rumble in the night, and a snatch of music, and someone shouting Ole! but it might have been a cat with aspirations.<br>
Did someone steal the van again? Teo asked, already dialing.<br>
No, Lola said slowly, looking at the letter again, as if paper could be a mirror. She left.<br>
The news that afternoon featured a shot of San Fermín. White pants, red scarves, adrenaline packaged as tradition. And there, in the crowd, unmistakable as a friend in a dream: a white rectangular shape, gleaming. People cheered. The van ran with the bulls. Carmen VanDiego drifted between horns with the grace of a swan on roller skates. A commentator said something about the new face of extreme sports. Someone else said, Finally, a vehicle that understands festival culture.<br>
Panic and Lola and Teo watched, mouths open to catch flies of bewilderment. The bulls seemed delighted. Or confused. Or enlightened. It's hard to tell with bulls; they're very tight-lipped.<br>
Should we go after her? Teo asked, his hand on his heart as if it were an engine he could crank.<br>
Lola shook her head. I think she's on her own journey.<br>
And then, reader, the last wink. The dashboard light, in absentia, stopped blinking. Not because the problem was solved. Because sometimes you don't need the sign anymore to know what it was saying.<br>
They went outside. The garage stood there, newly honest. The sky was a lidless eye. They sat on the curb and ate the last of the cheese that had not committed crimes. They laughed and cried the way people do when something really big has gone slightly absurd.<br>
You realize, Teo said, our optimism finally saved us.<br>
How so?<br>
If Carmen wants to flirt with mortality, she can do it without us.<br>
They published their book. They took public transport and called it anthropology. They learned to read the signs. All of them. Stop. Flood Zone. No Camping. Altura Maxima. Low Battery. Friend Requests.<br>
Sometimes people wrote and said, You inspired us to buy a van. Lola would write back, We inspired you to buy a library card. Teo would add, And a squeegee.<br>
And every July, they watched the footage. Carmen VanDiego, fearless idiot, gleaming rectangle among muscle and myth, outrunning their need to narrate it. Running with the bulls, without them. Spain was not trying to kill them, after all. Spain was running with its own ridiculous dignity. And somewhere out there, maybe, Pepito, in a tiny white scarf, shouting solidarity.<br>
If we must end with a moral, let it be this: The universe is not your mirror. It is a river. Sometimes it floods your campsite. Sometimes it carries your van to glory. Learn to swim, learn to squeegee, and for the love of god, if a dashboard light winks, buy it dinner or fix the pump. Either way, pay attention. It's much funnier that way.</p>
