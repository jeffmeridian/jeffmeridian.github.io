<p>The sign said CLEARANCE 12'6 in cheerful yellow paint, which would have been comforting if the bridge didn't look like it had been built during a time when people traveled by donkey and prayer.<br>
Don't be cute, I told the sign, pumping the brakes on my white Sprinter and squinting up at the rust and ivy and somebody's unfortunate graffiti: LIVE FREE OR DIE LOW.<br>
Behind me, someone laid on a horn long and hard, like that alone powered the laws of physics. I rolled down my window and held up one finger, the universal gesture for 'I am not dying for your impatience.' Then my phone pinged with a DM: Loved your post on low clearances! Can't wait to see how you problem-solve today ;<br>
Reader engagement is reason number forty-two to keep notifications off when my pulse is trying to break the sound barrier.<br>
Okay, I said to my van, to the bridge, to the universe, we do this by the book.<br>
My book, technically. I am the author of How Not to Die in a Van, the blog that turned my tics into traffic-color-coded checklists, worst-case-scenario drills, and soothing humor about how I really can't relax unless I've triple-checked the propane is off and the doors are locked and the fire extinguisher isn't expired. That last one just for fun.<br>
Now I grabbed my fiberglass measuring pole, hopped out, and marched to the bridge as the impatient horn turned petulant. The road was gravely underfoot, the Oregon sky low as wet wool. Cicadas sawed in the bushes. The old metal of the bridge groaned and dropped a flake of rust onto my upturned palm, like a coin from a god.<br>
Twelve six, my ass, I muttered, spotting the faint line where someone had repainted the numbers. I stretched the pole, marked the arch at my lane. Eleven ten if I was lucky. My rig was eleven eight with the roof fan. On a good day. On a bad day, it was a cry, a scream, and public embarrassment.<br>
I waved down the driver behind me, a man in a baseball cap with a red face. Hey! It's mis-marked! I shouted. You'll shave your AC!<br>
Before he could shout back, a voice said, You need a spotter? Or a therapist?<br>
I turned to find a man leaning on a tow truck parked under a dripping cedar. Everything about him said watch your wallet and your heart-lean, sun-browned forearms, a mouth that knew how to smirk and kiss and ruin you for other mouths, eyes the color of stormwater in a ditch you don't see until it's too late. He wore a navy T-shirt under a grease-smeared open flannel, jeans with the kind of wear that comes from actual work, and a wrench tucked in his back pocket like a threat.<br>
I brought my own therapist, I said, tapping the checklist laminated on my passenger-side window. But sure. Spot me.<br>
He sauntered up, lazy and efficient like a big cat who knows he can outrun you. What do you got, Sprinter? Eleven what?<br>
Eight, I said. And I don't do guys who guess. Measure.<br>
He took the pole, slid it up like he'd been born with it. Eleven ten at center, he confirmed, then tipped the pole as if to pray at me. Move left, take the crown. You'll have an inch.<br>
An inch? I repeated. That's an eyebrow.<br>
Eyebrows are underrated, he said gravely. Just don't flinch. Flinching is when people lose rooftop fans.<br>
Do I look like I flinch?<br>
Yes, he said, amused. But with style.<br>
I considered my choices. Option A: back up with a line of RVs honking, probably end up in a compilation video titled 'Ten Times Entitled Vanlifers Ruined a Tuesday.' Option B: trust a stranger who looked like he'd robbed a county fair of all its good genetics. Option C: die under a bridge, my epitaph a plaque of my own laminated checklist.<br>
I bit my lip. The DM pinged again. Watching you! it read, with a winky face that felt like a hand at my neck.<br>
Crown, I said to the man. No flinching.<br>
Attagirl, he murmured, stepping into my lane with the confidence of a matador.<br>
I took a breath and eased forward, hugging the left arc where the bridge arched highest. My mirrors were practically making out with the rust. My heart was a drum solo. One inch feels like a universe when steel and fiberglass are plotting a high-speed elopement. The man's hand moved in precise motions, tap-tap toward me, palm up, then slowing. He pointed two fingers to his eyes and back to mine. Watch me, not the bridge.<br>
I watched him. He smiled like sin and summers and survival.<br>
We cleared with a whisper that kissed my roof vent and didn't take it. A whoop rose in the chorus of honks behind us, and I exhaled the kind of breath that leaves you craving a cigarette you never want and a nap you can't afford.<br>
The man, my spotter, walked up to my window and leaned in. He smelled like hand cleaner and pine. You owe me a thank-you. And your name.<br>
Evie Hart, I said. And thank you, stranger danger.<br>
Kai, he said. Mercer. I'm a mechanic. I flirt for sport and torque specs.<br>
Your turn-ons are bolts? I asked, arching a brow.<br>
Top five, he said, eyes skateboarding over my face without apology. You headed to the rally?<br>
Am I wearing the tri-fold brochure of my own anxiety? I asked, gesturing to my van's flanks plastered with decals: How Not to Die in a Van, a cartoon me in hiking boots holding a first aid kit like a bouquet.<br>
That and the powerpoint in your eyes, he said. I'm heading there too. Hired out for the weekend. Fixing leaks, soothing egos, preventing barbeques.<br>
Preventing barbeques?<br>
Propane, he said. Someone's been messing with rigs the last few meets. Tires, gas lines, weird stuff. Could be prank-level, could be human-level stupid, could be something else. Folks get twitchy. Then I get busy.<br>
I blinked. That was the rumor-accidents that weren't accidents and a general vibe of dread. I'd written about the basics of safety at rallies because the DMs started filling with things like Saw a rig smoking last night! And Not like fun smoking! And A guy here says your blog is cute but real vanlifers don't worry. Cue my rage.<br>
You think someone's targeting people? I asked.<br>
I think wherever there's a gathering and money on wheels, there's a crime of opportunity, he said easily. I also think you attract trouble like a magnet wrapped in skin.<br>
Is that a mechanic pickup line? I asked.<br>
Only if you like it, he said. See you at the fairgrounds, Hart. Try not to die on the way.<br>
He tapped the roof of my van twice and strolled back to his tow truck, leaving me with a flutter under my breastbone and the unsettling feeling that someone had just seen me and filed the information away.<br>
He hadn't said he followed my blog. But it bled into the way he said my name.<br>
The rally was the kind of organized chaos festival that happens when too many wheels try to make a neighborhood and succeed anyway. Food trucks, dogs in bandanas, solar panels glinting, a sunburned guy in a hat that said EAT DUST hawking composting toilet supplies. I rolled into my assigned slot and surveyed my neighbors: a retired couple with a forty-foot Class A that had more square footage than my first apartment, a tattooed woman in a school bus whose hood art was a dragon eating traffic cones, and a small silver teardrop trailer with a chalkboard sign reading HONEYMOON OR BUST.<br>
Bust, someone had scrawled under it in different handwriting.<br>
I stepped out and immediately inhaled smoke from a nearby campfire, a scent that always made my brain produce memory collages of every time I'd almost done something rash and then hadn't. My nerves buzzed, the way they did when I felt a story tug me toward it.<br>
One ping. Then another. My phone lit with DMs, most harmless: Saw you at the bridge! You saved my roof! Others, less so: Make sure you lock up tonight. I'd hate to see you lose something important.<br>
I muted the app.<br>
You look like someone who carries a trauma kit and a stun gun, a voice said.<br>
I do, I said without turning, because in a field of milling van people he had that presence again, like gravity had laid a hand on me. Which do you need?<br>
Kai stepped into my peripheral with a wrench in one hand and a bag of kettle corn in the other. He offered me a handful, which I took to be polite and also because it was warm and dusted in sugar and what if he'd poisoned it? I popped a piece in my mouth and waited to see if my throat closed.<br>
Riveting content, he said. Van safety influencer eats anonymous kettle corn. Will she live? Stay tuned.<br>
If I die, tell my readers I went doing what I loved, I said sweetly. Being petty and right.<br>
He laughed, the sound like a motorcycle idling between your knees and a good bottle of whiskey poured over ice. You want petty and right? Somebody's been loosening valve caps.<br>
Valve caps, I repeated. For what. Irritated squirrels?<br>
Propane, he said. And tires. Get enough slow leaks and people chalk it up to luck. Or bad maintenance. Or a sign that their marriage is failing. People project.<br>
I thought of my DMs. Of the bridge. Of the way the numbers on that sign had been painted slightly off-color. I thought of how I had built a life on anticipating the worst and the worst had started to send me winky faces.<br>
What do you want from me, Kai? I asked, aiming for breezy and hitting braced.<br>
He held my gaze like it was a wrench he fitted to a nut. A favor. The organizers want me to keep an eye out. Someone else wants you to keep your head down. Let's do neither. Let's make a scene.<br>
You're going to have to put those words in a sentence with fewer red flags, I said. What kind of scene.<br>
Fake dating, he said, grinning wicked. We'll pretend to be a couple. People talk to couples. People look at us and see something they don't want to eavesdrop on.<br>
Because it's gross? I asked.<br>
Because it's personal, he said. Trust me. You being around me gives me eyes. Me being around you gives you cover. If someone's using your posts for their pregame, they'll want to see you up close. Let's make sure they see what we want them to.<br>
There it was. The ask. And the thrum in my chest that was half fear, half something I didn't have a checklist for.<br>
I don't fake date, I said. My readers are weirdly invested in my brand of single-person competence. Also, who said it would be fake?<br>
His mouth tilted like a confession. We can negotiate terms.<br>
Boundaries, I said, relenting because if someone was using my own words against me, I was not going to sit in my van and hope the universe disliked irony. No lying to me. Not about work, not about your past, not about your favorite font. No touching without asking. No using me as bait unless I willingly play the cheese. No sleeping in my van unless I invite you.<br>
Sans serif, he said. CONSENT in all caps. And if I'm not honest, you kick me in the shins.<br>
Deal, I said, sticking out my hand.<br>
He shook it, and his hand swallowed mine, rough and warm, a promise and a dare.<br>
By midday, we were a couple. We told the retired couple on one side that we'd met over a flat tire, which was technically true: I'd had one last year, and men like him, with hands like a map to better decisions, had stopped to help. We told the dragon-bus woman we were trying out monogamy like a new hiking trail. We told the honeymooners we were collecting stories for our grandkids, which made the bride cry and cling to her groom and shove us homemade brownies that could double as ballast.<br>
I taught a clinic called Propane Isn't a Verb, and caught Kai leaning on a picnic table at the back, watching me like someone memorizing a manual he'll need to throw out later. He asked smart questions in the right places, pushed me into specific safety tips that sounded casual and weren't: How do you tell if someone's touched your lines? What's a normal smell versus panic? How often do you replace gaskets?<br>
Later, he lowered his voice as a breeze lifted the scent of grilled onions and dog shampoo across our campsite. You're good, he said. If people listened, I'd be out of a job.<br>
If people listened, we'd all be out of jobs, I said. What do you hear?<br>
He flicked his eyes over the milling crowd: men in cargo shorts, women in straw hats, kids on scooters, dogs in stroller-prisons. Rumors, he said. A silver rig got its battery drained overnight. A couple found their carbon monoxide detector mysteriously disabled. A guy I know had a slow leak in his brake line.<br>
My scalp prickled. My phone pinged again with a DM: Loved the clinic! Don't get too comfortable. The van world is hungry.<br>
We spent the evening doing couple stuff in a way that didn't feel fake. He cooked-of course he did-metal spatula ringing on the skillet as he seared chicken thighs and onions, while I chopped peppers with precision I pretended was not a cry for control. We ate sitting on my bumper, our knees touching in accidental-knowing ways, and I had to keep reminding myself that this was for the mission, not because I liked how he watched me laugh as if he'd been starved and I was the first person who'd handed him anything worth chewing.<br>
When the first scream cut the night, we were mid-banter about following distances.<br>
Three seconds, I was saying. Minimum. More if your rig's heavy.<br>
I hate that number, he said. Feels like waiting for permission.<br>
That's what patience is, I said, smirking. Permission from your better self.<br>
He opened his mouth to retort when the sound knifed the air again. Not fun. Not drunk. Real.<br>
We were moving before we had a plan, drawn toward the silver Airstream where a woman flailed on the step, her hands white on the rail. It smells! It smells like- She gagged.<br>
Kai was in, shoulder to the door, cold focus sliding over his features like a mask. I pulled my shirt over my mouth and flipped the lights on. The smell hit like a ghost-a fog of rotten eggs and fear.<br>
Gas off, Kai barked, and the husband, pale and useless, stammered I-what lever?<br>
Out, I said to the wife, coaxing her back. Everyone out. Breathe through your mouth. Don't touch any switches.<br>
We found the source in seconds-someone had cracked the stove line and left the smallest twist on the valve. It was low, insidious, the kind that makes you sleepy and stops your breath in the night.<br>
I close my valves, the woman said, starting to cry. I do. I swear I do.<br>
Kai glanced at me, something hard in his eyes. He looked at the brass fitting, then the wrench marks. Yeah, he said softly. Someone else opened it.<br>
The sheriff who'd been hired for the event to walk around and look authoritative materialized, took statements, promised patrols, and left us with the satisfying feeling of being patted on the head.<br>
I crouched on the grass and pretended to scroll my phone. DMs, again. You teach so well. So easy to follow your steps. Evie, you should be proud. The little heart emoji winked like it was trying to warn me of itself.<br>
He squatted next to me, his leg warm against mine. You okay?<br>
Yes, I lied.<br>
Evie, he said in the tone that had me visualizing surrender. Truth.<br>
No, I admitted. This is my nightmare. Someone is using my lists to hurt people.<br>
We'll make a new list, he said.<br>
I looked up at him. Rule one, I said. No one dies.<br>
He nodded, as if filing that under baseline. Rule two, he said. If anyone tries to hurt you, we hurt them back.<br>
How legally? I asked.<br>
We'll negotiate, he said, and even his smile had teeth.<br>
The next two weeks compressed like an accordion. We traveled with the caravan from Oregon's rain-slicked lumberyards to the parabola of the California coast, across desert highways that simmered like a mirage you could fall into and never get out. Our fake relationship became a dance of strategic intimacy and a game we were both winning. We kissed once in front of a particularly nosy vendor and discovered that pretending was a door you could open only if you wanted to end up on the other side, stripped of lies. We slept under the same roof because it made us look real and because the night can feel like a long hallway you need another heartbeat to cross.<br>
The accidents escalated, subtle and sharp. A tire blowout on a blind curve in Nevada that we managed with a controlled sway, my fingers bloodless on the wheel as Kai talked me down, his voice a rope I climbed hand over hand. A stolen rig in Santa Fe that careened through a campsite and left crushed coolers and shaken retirees in its wake as sirens lit the dusk; we were the ones who got the plate and gave chase long enough for the cops to corner it, my van's engine whining as Kai grinned like a wolf and said Trust me, and I did, God help me.<br>
We started seeing the pattern. The sabotage matched my content, week by week. Disable the CO detector? That was my video from last year about testing your alarms monthly. Loosen tire valve cores? That was my post on the importance of a gauge you can trust. The DMs didn't stop. They doubled. Pictures of my van from angles I hadn't been present in. Notes left under my wipers: Your lists make me feel safe. Let's make sure everyone learns.<br>
It wasn't fans anymore. It was someone cosplaying competence and hiding in my shadow.<br>
We narrowed suspects and then blew the list wide open. The retired couple had a grandson who looked at my legs like he'd discovered legs were legal and wished they weren't; he also had hands too soft to know a wrench from a spoon. The dragon-bus woman carried a knife on her belt and a brick of beeswax in her pocket; she also passed out on her roof every evening with a book over her face and no time for sabotage. The honeymooners-no comment. They barely found the bed.<br>
It was the small stuff that made me tip. A guy named Cole who ran a mobile detailing service, he liked to chat while polishing rims, and he had a tattoo of a raven that peered up from his wrist like a warning. He laughed at my jokes the way you do when you want to echo someone's sound. He asked questions about how I vet sources and whether I quiz my audience. He took a picture with me and kept his hand light and careful at my waist, which most men thought translated to respect. He didn't follow me on Instagram. But someone had made a burner called HuntsTheRoad that followed every single person I tagged.<br>
Kai, I said in Arizona, standing under a sky like a struck match, if this is someone I know, I'm going to need a week to scream.<br>
You can have two, he said, because he was generous with time he didn't actually have the right to give.<br>
We were sweating in the heat one afternoon when the wasps hit. Someone had left the cap off my gray water, maybe, or someone had found a nest. They poured out of the vent like a magic trick from hell.<br>
Run, Kai said calmly, snatching my wrist as the first angry blur found my hair.<br>
We did, stumbling into the campground shower house, breathless and slapping at our clothes, yelping as a few determined jerks stung our ankles. He shoved open the door to the disabled stall, flipped on the water, and pulled me in fully clothed. Cold water blasted down, plastering my shirt to my skin. We yanked the curtain closed and pressed together to avoid the spray, which was everywhere, so: chaos.<br>
Don't look, I said, already laughing because adrenaline always turns into inappopriate humor for me.<br>
I'm busy being a gentleman, he said, not sounding even a little like one.<br>
By the time the wasps had settled on the other side of the curtain like an audience, my shirt was transparent and my jeans were a second skin. He was soaked, water running down the ridges of him, turned-on and trying to pretend he wasn't.<br>
Evie, he said, voice gone rough. Consent.<br>
Please, I said, on a breath that felt like a surrender note.<br>
We kissed with the kind of relief that tastes like a tongue after danger, with the kind of hunger that had been building for states, and when his hand slid under my shirt and paused, I put my hand over his and pressed. We didn't do anything that could be mistaken for not wanting. We did everything we'd been wanting to do. It wasn't neat. It wasn't quiet. It wasn't fake.<br>
After, we leaned against tile and laughed like we'd gotten away with something. He kissed my forehead and whispered, You wreck me. I said, Good, and meant it with a part of me that knew wreckage could be rebuilt.<br>
Night in New Mexico brought us the turn. We were camped on the edge of nothing, sky full of stars, when I found the receipt in Kai's toolbox: a purchase for specialized valve cores and a set of gaskets that matched the one we'd found cracked on the Airstream. My stomach fell through the floor.<br>
Kai, I said, holding up the paper like a warrant.<br>
He looked at it, at me, and I saw it for the first time: something old and ugly in him scratching at the door. He could lie. He could tell a better story. He could eat me whole.<br>
Instead he exhaled. I used to work with a crew, he said, voice like cut gravel. Not just mobile mechanics. People who boosted rigs. I got out two years ago. I'm still an easy mark for their gossip. Those parts? I bought them to compare. To recognize when they'd been touched. It's cheaper to buy a set than to miss a variation.<br>
I stared at him, fury and hurt boiling. And you didn't tell me because?<br>
Because you wouldn't have let me in, he said, bleak. Because you'd think the worst. Because sometimes I am the worst.<br>
Is it you? I asked, which was the most insulting and honest thing I'd ever said.<br>
He flinched like I'd slapped him. No.<br>
Then who? I demanded.<br>
He raked a hand through his hair. I have a name. He looked ill saying it. Cole. The detailer. He's not with the old crew, but he's been asking questions in the wrong circles. Rumor is he wants to start something new. Not theft. Something worse. Viral sabotage. Accidents that trend.<br>
My blood iced. He's using my content.<br>
He's using you as cover. If it looks like clumsy fans, no one glues the malice to one man.<br>
I stepped back, nauseated. We tell the sheriff, I said. Now.<br>
We will, he said. But we need proof he can't wriggle out of. Otherwise? He walks and watches us through a scope.<br>
What do we do? I asked.<br>
Set a trap, he said grimly. Let him think he's staging his masterpiece. Then pull the curtain.<br>
The Texas rally was big and dusty and had a ferris wheel for absolutely no reason other than the human need to rise and fall in loops while holding someone's hand. We rolled in like a couple who had survived miles and came out glossier, which was actually a good cover for the fact that my nerves were shot and Kai was vibrating at a frequency that made the hair on my arms rise.<br>
We'd let word drop, through one of the chatty organizers, that I was scouting a new segment: The Ultimate Safety Drill. A staged runaway. A staged leak. Controlled, with professionals. We invited the sheriff and his bored deputy to watch me demonstrate how an emergency brake works on a slope. We brought in a small audience and pretended to fumble small things. We waited for Cole.<br>
He came with a smile and a rag tucked in his pocket, pleasant in a way that would always get him invited into your life. He asked questions and told jokes and edged closer to my rig like he was magnetized. He wore a watch with a cracked face and a look that said I'm already inside your house.<br>
The plan was simple: we'd set the test rig with a known flaw we could control. A hairline crack in the propane line that only vented if a valve was turned two extra twists past rational. We'd run the motorhome up a gentle slope and demonstrate a runaway in the safest way possible: slow, predictable, with blocks at the bottom and the sheriff standing there chewing a toothpick and pretending to care.<br>
Cole was supposed to watch. To salivate. To decide the show needed more.<br>
He did. He moved when he thought no one looked. He slipped under the rig and his hands moved like a magician's. He turned the valve that opened more than it should have. He pulled the chock. He did it with the economy of someone who's practiced and felt delicious doing it.<br>
Everything unfolded too fast with the inevitability of a math problem you got wrong three steps back. The rig rolled. The propane hissed. The sheriff, idiot, laughed. The crowd clapped because they thought they were watching safety porn.<br>
Kai, I breathed.<br>
I've got the leak, he said, and was gone, diving for the side panel with a wrench like a weapon.<br>
The motorhome picked up speed. The blocks we'd set skittered under the tires like matchsticks. The slope was gentle, but the weight was a monster. Cole stood to the side, face alive. He wanted fire. He wanted a video of Evie Hart failing at her own gospel.<br>
Keys, I said, lunging for the door. No driver. Because on paper, no one needed to be inside.<br>
Evie, no! Kai shouted, wrestling the propane compartment open and cursing as the odorant made his eyes water. He had seconds to clamp the line before it hit air and made a molotov of the day. He needed me to not die while he did it.<br>
My readers love when I walk through the logic chain of an emergency. Step one: decide to live. Step two: trust your training. Step three: don't apologize for moving. There's no time for polite when the universe wants you meat.<br>
I grabbed the rail, hoisted myself in, and threw my body into the driver's seat as the rig creaked over a bump. The steering wheel was a door I slammed into the right space. I slammed my foot on the brake. Nothing. The hydraulic hissed like laughter. The pedal went to the floor and stayed.<br>
Parking brake, I said out loud because sometimes speaking is magic. It engaged and squealed but we still rolled. We were aimed at a low fence and beyond that another row of campers lined like dominos.<br>
You always have options. Even when you think you don't. They just get uglier.<br>
The gear lever, bless it, was manual enough to bite. I threw it into low and gunned it for a second, feeling the torque like a punch, then took my foot off. Engine compression slowed us a tick. The slowness was a thread. I pulled it. Pumped. Pumped again. The brakes grabbed in tiny chews. The wheel shivered and wanted to jerk. I braced my forearms and held it like it was an animal I could gentle.<br>
Outside, the world narrowed. People moved like they were in glue. The ferris wheel turned lazy, utterly unhelpful. I smelled the rotten-egg ghost and then the sharper smell of hot metal and terror. Kai cursed like it was a prayer and a promise. You've got it, he roared, and I believed him because if faith was a person, it was him, lying on his back under a wheeled bomb and trusting me to do my job.<br>
The fence was a chest-high run of wood and wire. I aimed not for it, but for an empty patch where two rigs had gone for tacos. Left, right, a shimmy. A chock someone had left, orphan on the gravel. My tire hit it. The tiny resistance pitched the angle and we lost a piece of energy that mattered because sometimes a straw makes the camel look up and say wait, no.<br>
I yanked the parking brake up like my arm was offended. The rig slurred its own momentum. The front tires turned into the patch I'd aimed for. We came to a stop with a lurch that bruised my hips against the seat and my chest against the wheel.<br>
Everything went silent except for my heart.<br>
I heard Kai before I saw him-a cough, a string of profanity, the clatter of a wrench on gravel. He appeared at my window, hair smeared with dirt and a smear of something that I hoped was grease and not blood. He grinned, wide and feral and full of something you can't fake.<br>
Evie, he said. You did it.<br>
You did it, I said, a laugh hitching around the edges like it didn't know if it was supposed to be relief or trauma.<br>
He opened the door. Out, he said, and I let him pull me, solid hand around my wrist, into the heat and the noise and the people running toward us and the stunned faces.<br>
The sheriff shook himself awake and charged at Cole, who was trying to slink backward into the crowd. Kai intercepted him at an angle like a linebacker. Cole's face did that thing where a charming person realizes they're not charming anymore. He opened his mouth. Kai's fist met it first.<br>
Consent? he asked me over his shoulder, eyes dangerous.<br>
Granted, I said. For once.<br>
They cuffed him. He spat blood and a line about how it was all an accident and we misunderstood his intentions. The deputy found a kit in his van with spare valve cores and caps and small labeled baggies with terms like BRAKE CHEW. My name was scrawled inside the lid. He'd written my catchphrases next to pictures of rigs on index cards, loops of careful handwriting that looked like love if you didn't read the content.<br>
The crowd buzzed. A woman hugged me too hard. A guy put his hand on my shoulder in a way that made Kai shift closer, not to growl, but to anchor.<br>
When the dust settled, when the elective persecution of paperwork had drained us both enough to sit, we sat on the bumper of my van and let the night breathe around us. The ferris wheel lights blinked like a heartbeat finding a rhythm again. The sheriff muttered apologies that didn't matter and thank-yous that did. People brought us beer. A kid with freckles asked me if I was scared. I told him yes, and that not being scared is a myth. Brave is a verb.<br>
You chose, Kai said softly, later, when it was just us and the stretch of darkness and the knowledge that morning would make this all more real. You didn't flinch.<br>
I did, I said honestly, because sometimes the flinch is where you find your edges. But toward the wheel.<br>
He leaned his head against mine. You're a menace. And the bravest person I know.<br>
You don't know many people, I said, and he huffed a laugh.<br>
I turned to him and said the thing that had been burning a hole in me since the shower, since the bridge, since the first time he'd looked at me like I could ruin him and he'd help. I don't want to fake this anymore.<br>
He went still. You mean-<br>
I mean I don't want to pretend to like you, I said, because the truth is sharp and clean. I want to like you while you try very hard to be a man who tells the truth. I want to write a post about being careful and brave and falling in love with someone who makes you feel safe enough to be stupid sometimes.<br>
His laugh cracked in the best place. I can do that, he said. The man part. The truth part. The making-you-safe part. The stupid I can help with too if you need it.<br>
Boundaries remain, I said.<br>
CONSENT remains, he echoed.<br>
We kissed like we had a future that could be planned for. The night softened. The DM notifications were blessedly off. The list in my head reshuffled around a new central item: allow for joy.<br>
In the morning, I filmed a video. My hair was a mess and my face looked like I'd lived, because I had. I told my readers about brake checks and trust. I told them about the saboteur-and I told them that while we can do everything right, some people will still pick at our seams. I told them about community, and how you make a safer world not by pretending danger doesn't exist, but by standing closer when it does.<br>
I didn't tell them about the shower, or the look he gives me when I balance risks and rewards. Some things belong to the road and the people in your passenger seat.<br>
We left Texas on a morning so clear it felt like a dare. As we pulled out, a bridge glowered at us with a sign that said CLEARANCE 13'2 like it meant it and had proof.<br>
Crown? Kai asked, hand on my thigh.<br>
Always, I said, and took the left arc with a margin so generous it felt like luxury.<br>
Our lists are still laminated. Our jokes are still barbed. His past is still something that knocks sometimes, ugly and uninvited, and we answer with the deadbolt on. My fear still wakes me at four in the morning and makes me count fire extinguishers. We're still moving, through rain and desert and places where the sky is too much and the land is too honest.<br>
We fall in love between accidents, sometimes during them. We choose our story like we choose our exits: last second, sometimes, heart in throat, laughing anyway.<br>
How not to die in a van: don't be alone if you can help it. Make a checklist and then throw it out when someone's life depends on you doing something bolder. Sit on the bumper after and let someone put their hand on the small of your back like a promise he intends to keep. Plan for everything and then make room for the one thing you didn't.<br>
The road will always take. We're learning to make it give back.</p>
