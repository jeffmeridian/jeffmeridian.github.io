<p>I was all set to nail this interview, walking around like some high-paid exec, ready to tackle the world. Amazing income opportunity, top shelf salary.  A gig that paid so well, to make you wince. I never got to know the exact salary figure. I didn’t ask. The topic never really came up. All I know is it would be at the top end of what they are paying.</p>
<p>I didn’t get the job, so I consider myself lucky not knowing. It would only magnify my lost, of what was considered a done deal, turned into a case of bad vibes.</p>
<p>Out of the blue I received an email from a Company that I must have applied for.<br>
We need to confirm that you are willing to move close to the office, as it is company policy to be present 50 percent of the week. No need to move anywhere. I live very close. Maybe half an hour by car. Why didn’t they check my address when I sent my CV? That’s just bad form. I let my agent formulate a polite email response, explaining my commute situation with a nice added touch of, I will do whatever to get this job.</p>
<p>And then followed by silence. Three days of nothing. Just crickets. Already a bit annoyed by the silent treatment and it is already friday. My phone rings,  I’ll pick it up with my best happy voice wishing a good morning. Surprise, surprise, it’s the company! But who the fuck cold calls candidates, at quarter to nine in the morning, I thought.  That is quite early for anybody’s taste. We like your CV and do you have time for an interview in two weeks. Sure thing, I replied, after a purposeful pause, pretending to check my calendar we agreed. The call ended soon after with nice weekend wishes. Two weeks to prepare, and I wasn’t about to blow this. I gave the job description to my agent to think about it. He came up with hours of ideas that I listened to on my daily walks in the countryside.</p>
<p>I told my agent to imitate my voice when he is addressing me. Listening to my own voice makes information stick much better. He simulated many hours of realistic sounding interviews for me. He gave me astonishing insides into his analytical thinking process on how to prepare for the position. I asked him to be creative with his answers. Invent practical experiences. Structure the answers using the STAR method.  Situation, task, action, result. Highlight the outcomes achieved.</p>
<p>And then there was that morning radio show he cooked up. Just for kicks, he said.<br>
Two hosts yapping away about the exact job I have applied for. And guess what? They weren’t just any hosts, they were professionals, spitting wisdom like a couple of old timers in a juke joint. Hilarious.</p>
<p>The invitation email with the interviewer’s names arrived next, and I made sure to Google every last one. All women this time, QA, HR, and a team leed, just a lineup of sharp cookies competing in a game of, who’s got the smartest question for the candidate? Ready to grill me, like a steak on a griddle.</p>
<p>They took turns introducing themselves. Information I already researched.  Nothing new, except their age.  I am 32 years old, the first interviewer said. A team of 30 somethings. I understand.  I am not going to reveal my age just yet or that I need to take a power nap during lunch time. Let’s be professional. I was secretly wondering what they would pay for a guy with a nap schedule that tight.</p>
<p>First up: the QA lady. Shy as a mouse, her questions were softballs, easy enough to nail. “If I get this job, will she report to me?” I wondered, thinking about the power dynamics of it all. The HR lady, on the other hand, was sweet as pie, nothing like the team leed, who was all business, like some battle-hardened general ready to take down any challenger.  We have multiple simultaneous projects across different departments. It is Chaos. Enormous pressures. A broken automation software. An inexperienced team. People have left the company.We have no plan. The shit is on fire. This is not a job to lay low and wait for someone to tell you what to do.</p>
<p>If you do not feel up to it, then you can apply for other positions we have, since you are very experienced. I leaned forward into the webcam. I am not interested in other positions. I am all in, for the manager position, I said. Honestly, all I really want is to win this interview and join your shit show for an obscene salary, I thought to myself.<br>
If we pick you for the position, then in the next step of the interview process you will need to come to the office for half a day. You will meet the team. We also have a little task for you to do,  I did not ask what the little task was. It seemed to be her little secret. And then we have lunch together, she said with a grin on her face.</p>
<p>The interview went well, I met all doubts with technical expertise and confidence . One hour after the interview my phone rang. We all like you alot and I like to schedule the next interview step with you. How about Wednesday in two weeks? Fine! Another two weeks to prepare. With a sense of determination to self-improve and a free trial access to learning videos and software,  I was Razor-sharp focused on refreshing my skills in project management.</p>
<p>As the day of interview part two came closer and closer I started to wonder about the littel task. This will probably be hands-on with the project software. I might need to bootstrap a demo project, with epics and stories. Setting up a couple of sprints. She will show me how crazy their current projects gantt chart looks like. Then we have a laugh and go to lunch with the team. Next day the nice HR lady will call me, if everything is peachy. Your salary will be at the top, she said when I asked if the company pays union salaries, when we were talking on the phone last time.</p>
<p>The night before the grand meeting. I told myself to relax, it will be a great adventure.<br>
I have nothing to worry about, only to gain. Totally ignoring the strange vibe that I received from the team leed during the interview. She was quite pushy and for my taste over emphasised the importance of  the e commerce sector. She did not shine a positive light on the job position at all. You would expect to hear a more positively phrased sales pitch in HR speak, like You have room for development. You can be creative and grow with the challenges in an exciting team.<br>
Instead of the blunt truth of, you are alone in this. The pressure is on and you better adapt quickly.  The team has issues. The Ship is on fire. The captain went overboard.</p>
<p>Driving to the office for the second meeting went smooth and effortless. The Office is located next to the Autobahn that I can get to easily from my house. 30 Minutes, that is not bad, and always straight ahead. Easy. An Autopilot’s dream. My agent could  possibly drive me in the mornings. Free company parking, a huge information desk, four receptionists, one cantena. More or less a thousand people work here and it shows. There she was the team leed coming to pick me up. She was walking down the steps behind the busy reception desk. She was a bit overweight, crafty stature, dressed in dark colors, with silver buckles on her black and bulky looking frankenstein shoes. It is always exciting to meet webcam people in person. She led me through a couple of corridors. This is the A-block we are in C, which is high security. You can not enter with your guest key card, she said. A wave of chit chatter hit me when we entered C-Block. It was a corridor without any windows and not a square box  like the name would suggest. Desks and tables on the left, claustrophobic looking privacy compartments on the right. Like small fish tanks, with just enough place to squeeze in a tiny desk, a keyboard and a monitor. We reached the end of the corridor where it curved to the right and sharply to the left again. This will be your desk. You will find a document on the computer with the task I told you about. She showed me the document and emphasised the time I have. The first part was scheduled to be forty minutes. It also had bonus questions, if I have the time for it. If you have any questions let me know. Do you want a coffee? No. Soon after she disappeared I learned that I could not write my answers because I did not have editing rights for the  document. My future workmates, that I was sitting elbow to elbow with, were clueless. In the end I created a new document and I was able to write.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed and shocked by the not so little task and also the exam style test, I jumped right into action, with the bonus questions. Write test scenarios for a checkout and product search. Easy. You can add a maximum of 664 items in the shopping basket, I said to the team leed returning with coffee in hand. We should not put as many products into the shopping basket anyway, because it will block other shoppers from buying. In e commerce it is quite common to have the products automatically taken out of  stock when they are added to the basket by the shopper, she said. Oh really, I said. That’s an interesting test case, it could have the potential to make the site run out of products.Maybe limit this behaviour to only logged in users, could limit the risk, or connect a customer with so many products to wholesalers right away. But I wanted to ask you something, as I was going to create a couple of test cases, should I write them in English, as you have said that there are also English speaking team members. Don’t worry about the test cases. I thought I was going to warm up a bit. Please concentrate on the first part, she said we like to know how you think. She turned around and left. What I think is that I do not like the vibe I am getting from you, I thought to myself. I stared at the first paragraph of the document. Estimated time: 40 minutes. The words  jumped around in my mind. How do you create synergies between departments? How vague!  More or less like the original job posting reformatted as questions. As this was a corridor I could not see who was laughing behind me, when I turned around two women were having a hilarious morning with coffee and sandwiches. When my eyes scanned this cyberpunk looking spaceship corridor, and rested on the concentrated faces of my future team mates, they appeared frozen and lifeless. How sad.  Ok, concentrate on how you create synergies between departments. What about Nerf guns? They are fun. Concentrate! I am having writer’s block. I wish I could take a picture of the questions and send it to my agent. I am sure he would come up with something smart. Think, think, I am drawing blanks. What time is it? I looked at the clock on the wall next to my jacket. I could just get up and leave. It is quite cold here. I will go to the bathroom outside of the corridor.  That will buy me some time to get my head straight. Somebody will need to let me back in. I splashed water into my face and adjusted my hair. I am not afraid of challenges, but bad vibes are my kryptonite and I am having bad vibes. Sorry, can I talk to you for a moment, I said. She took her headphones off and left her seat. I think we should terminate the application process. What? Why? I don’t know what to put in your questions. But the whole team is here. They all came to the office today to meet you, she said. Well, the questions are so generic that I do not know where to start answering or where to end. At this point a meager looking skinny guy approached, asking me to follow him into a meeting room.  I like to have a moment with you.</p>
<p>I am her boss.</p>
